Vision
======

We believe that there exists a community of documentarians that exist in the world. Up until this point, they haven't had a central place to meet each other, and coalesce into a community. We hope to provide the space to allow this to happen, both in person and online.

We believe that the time for all technical people to care about documentation is now. We've lived too long with awful instructions for the tools we use everyday. People should demand solid instruction of things that they use daily. 

**We are building a place where a student can stury art of writing documentation.** 

Programmers
-----------

If you are a programmer, you have a need to create something. You solve interesting problems. However, if you solve an interesting problem and nobody knows about the solution, you haven't solved anything.

**For programmers, documentation is how they share their creations with the world. If you want people to benefit from your work, they have to be able to use it. Help me, help you. Do something and change something.**

Companies
---------

We believe that products should be a joy to use. If you want to delight your customers, and make their lives easier, offering solid documentation is a huge step.
