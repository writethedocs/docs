Write the Docs Newsletter – March 2020
######################################

Hello everyone! It's your friendly neighbourhood newsletter team, here with the March edition.

Our first bit of news: we're happy to announce the `results of last year's salary survey </surveys/salary-survey/2019/>`__! Openness is a core value of this community, so it's awesome to be able to present the anonymized data for your perusing.

On the conference side, it's super exciting to see the `roster of speakers for Portland </conf/portland/2020/news/announcing-speakers/#full-speaker-line-up>`__ announced a few weeks ago. Some seriously great talks to look forward to.

We wanted to also address the COVID-19 situation. Currently, *we have no plans to cancel* the Portland conference, but are planning to take additional precautions during the on-site events. We will be watching the situation closely over the next few weeks, and taking advice from the Oregon health authorities and United States CDC as it comes. We will assess the situation again next week and provide updates as the situation changes. 

And that's it for the news. It's been a month of great conversations on Slack, so let's head on to our stories!

------------------------------------------
Job listings and managing your assumptions
------------------------------------------
​
How should you approach a job search when you're more of the "writer who quickly learns technical topics" than the "developer who likes to write" sort of technical writer? February's conversation on this subject included tips for targeting and expanding your search, as well a discusssion about avoiding the limits of your own assumptions.
​
In terms of tips, try searching for job listings that mention more traditional tech writer tools, like MadCap Flare. These jobs may involve more focus on writing and less focus on programming experience. You could also search for different job titles: tech-writing-adjacent roles like UI/UX writer, content designer or content strategist, technical editor, information designer, documentation specialist, and product writer or product education.
​
These tips bloomed into a longer conversation about how your own biases and assumptions can reduce the number of jobs you apply for. Here are a few key points to consider:

- A more "technical" tech writing role may be open to someone who can write well already (arguably harder to teach) and pick up the technical concepts as they go. Make it clear that you're willing to learn! Every new job has a learning curve, no matter how technical you are.
- Write your cover letter and application to focus on the requirements that you *do* fit. You can address any gaps between your experience and the advert during the interview. If you're worried that applying when you don't meet all requirements is a waste of time, instead think of it as building experience talking about your skills and talents.
- Treat job listings as a wish list, not a list of requirements that you must match exactly. A `2014 Harvard Buisness Review article <https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified>`_ described how this assumption affects women in particular, and tools like `Shatter <https://www.shatter.live/>`_ aim to help women apply to more jobs and present themselves for leadership roles. "Apply even if you don't think you fit 100% of the requirements" is good advice for anyone. As one documentarian pointed out, if you qualify for 70% of the requirements, consider yourself a great candidate. Another put it this way: it's not your job to turn yourself down!
​
No matter what, remember that the types of jobs open are always changing, so don't get discouraged! There's plenty of help available on Slack community, especially #career-advice and #job-posts-only; and don't forget the `Write the Docs job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
