We stand with the Black community
=================================

The mission of Write the Docs is to support the growth of a diverse community of documentarians. Any threat to the diversity of our community is a threat to our entire community.

We are distraught by the suffering, oppression and systemic racism the Black community faces every day, and we cannot remain silent.

In silence, we are complicit. To eradicate racism, xenophobia, and all other forms of inequality, we must take action. It is our responsibility to use our platforms to amplify the voices of the oppressed and marginalized.

We ask today –– and always –– that the Write the Docs community comes together in support of the Black community. We will match donations to `non-profit organizations <https://blacklivesmatter.com/partners/>`_ that are supporting these efforts, up to a total of $1,500. Please `forward receipts <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ to us with a request for a matching donation.

We know that our words alone won’t fix this issue, but we choose to speak and act today to show solidarity with those who continue this important work.
