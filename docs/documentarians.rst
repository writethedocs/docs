Documentarians
==============

When we :doc:`created </origin-story>` Write the Docs,
we believed there was a missing term for someone who cares about documentation.
It shouldn't be a job title,
but with an independent identity.
We started using the word *documentarian* to describe this type of person:

**A documentarian is someone who cares about documentation and communication in the software industry, regardless of job title.**

Expanding the meaning of documentarian to include folks of any job title is important.
Historically, people writing documentation might be called either a tech writer or a programmer,
but there wasn't a name for someone who cares about communication and documentation.
We hope to change this.

Join us:

* If you're a programmer who loves writing docs, you're a documentarian
* If you're a tech writer and you appreciate usage of the precise word to convey a nuanced idea, you're a documentarian
* If you're a salesperson and documentation is a fundamental part of the sales process for your product, you're a documentarian
* If you're a support person and you love that documentation helps your users, you're a documentarian
* If you are a user of software and rejoice when there are instructions that help you, you're a documentarian

We hope that you'll join us in embracing this identity within our industry.
Being able to take pride in documentation and communication as part of your identity is a way to make sure we build a more empathetic and welcoming community.
