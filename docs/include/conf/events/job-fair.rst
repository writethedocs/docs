Connecting people with potential employers has always been a core benefit of attending Write the Docs, so we're excited to introduce some more structure to that connection.
The job fair will replace the Unconference for a few hours on Tuesday morning, documentarians looking for jobs will be able to visit employers at their table to learn about the company culture, ask about specific job openings and talk to current employees.

If you're an employer looking to fill a roll, you can find information about :doc:`reserving a table <sponsors/prospectus/>` in the sponsorship prospectus.
