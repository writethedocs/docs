Prague is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, and one of the best ways to experience it is by cruising in a boat up and down the Vltava river.
If you're only in town for a few days, it's a perfect sampling of the main architectural features and historical monuments of the city, most of which are near the river.

Of course, you can also walk around, but we tried that the first year and got a little sunburned! The next year, we got rained on, but being in a boat we didn't mind so much!
So join us on a two-hour cruise of the city's highlights, all the while being protected from the elements!
