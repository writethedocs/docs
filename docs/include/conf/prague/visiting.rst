Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Prague?

Traveling to Prague
-------------------

Prague has many direct rail, bus, and flight connections to most major European cities.
In the summer, there are also direct transatlantic flights to/from New York (JFK) and several other US airports.

Flights
~~~~~~~

Prague's `Vaclav Havel airport <http://www.prg.aero/en/>`__ provides many direct and low-cost flights with airlines such as Czech Airlines, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air Berlin, Norwegian... You get the idea.
To get from the airport to the city center, you can either take a the Airport Express bus (average journey time 25 minutes, cost ~60czk) or a taxi (average journey time 15-20 minutes depending on traffic, cost ~500czk).

Trains
~~~~~~

Prague's main train station (Hlavni Nadrazi / hl.n) is a central railway hub, with direct trains to Germany, Poland, Austria, and Hungary.
We recommend train lines by EuroCity (EC), InterCity (IC) or RailJet (RJ).
You can even take a train from Denmark `inside a ferry! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie>`__

To look up train connections, head over to the `ÄŒD Website <https://www.cd.cz/eshop/default.aspx>`__.

Buses
~~~~~

Prague is a popular destination among backpackers and shoestring travelers, so there are many affordable bus options if you are traveling within Europe.
The biggest Czech bus company `Student Agency <http://www.studentagency.eu/>`__ operates direct bus lines between Prague and cities like Berlin, Vienna, Zagreb, Munich, etc.
Global companies like `Eurolines <http://www.eurolines.com/en/>`__ operate direct lines to many European cities.

How to pay for things?!
-----------------------

Currency and cash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though Czech Republic is a member of the European Union, the currency is **Czech Koruna** (crown/CZK) and NOT Euro.
You can bring your Euros, Dollars, Pound Sterlings with you and exchange them at various locations in the city center.

**We do not recommend exchanging money at the airport or at the train station**. When looking for an exchange broker, find one that lists 0% commission, especially if you want to exchange relatively smaller amounts.

The exchange rate is roughly 25CZK/1EUR, 20CZK/1USD, and 30CZK/1GBP. Most modern restaurants and supermarkets accept credit and debit cards using a chip+pin machine, but some of the smaller pubs and bars still only accept cash, as do some taxi drivers. If you want to pay for a taxi ride with a credit card, remember to state this when you call ahead.

**Can you pay for things with Euro/Dollar/Pounds?** In the old town center, some places will accept these currencies, but please check the exchange rate very carefully, and you're likely to get change back in CZK.

Tipping and service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to most European countries, tipping culture is rather subdued in Czech Republic. The more tourist-oriented restaurants will be more vocal about tips, but in most cafes, bars, and pubs it's customary to round up the tab to a reasonable x10 or x100 number, and usually only for table service.

For example, if you sit down for lunch for two and your bill is 560czk (and you enjoyed the service!), you can round up the bill to 600czk. Make sure to tell the server how much you want to pay including the tip, as it's considered rude to leave change/tip on the table and depart.

How to get around
-----------------

Prague is a very accessible city and there are many transportation options available, public and otherwise.

Navigating in Prague
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you navigate by smartphone, Google Maps is the most popular method to calculate routes and travel times.
Do exercise caution when calculating walking routes, as the city center has many gated walkways that are locked at night.

Trams, buses, and metro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Prague Public Transit Co. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/>`__ runs an extensive network of trams, buses, and 3 metro lines.
You can buy a single ticket, day ticket, or 5-day pass at ticket machines, Trafika stands (tobacconists) and at the train and bus stations.

If you're flying into Prague Airport (PRG), you can take bus number 100, 119, or the Airport Express (AE) bus.
Depending on where you are staying, these bus lines will connect you to several major metro stations as well as the main train station. `More information on airport transfers. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/public-transit-to-prague-airport/>`__

Taxi companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prague is serviced by **Uber**, and it's the most reliable and cheapest way to secure direct transportation.
You can use your Uber app as you would in any other city where Uber is available, and you can choose Uber Pop (private cars) or Uber Black (fancy private cars).

Note: Uber in Czech Republic does not provide tax invoices, only e-receipts.
If you need a tax invoice or prefer to pay in cash, there are several reliable local taxi companies:

-  `AAA Taxi <http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/>`__
-  `Tick Tack <http://www.ticktack.cz/en>`__
-  `FIX Airport Taxi <https://fix-taxi.com/>`__

**IMPORTANT: Do not hail/flag taxis in the city center.** As with most major European cities, taxi scams do occur and can be easily avoided by calling in advance or using an official taxi stand (these are marked with a *TAXI* sign and a posted fact sheet in Czech and English).

Where to stay
-------------

Our venue Auto Klub is located across the road from the main train station, at the edge of the old town district (Prague 1).
We recommend booking accommodation in Prague 1 or Prague 2 area, on the west side of the railway station.

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations, but there are countless hotels and Airbnb apartments available within walking distance of the venue.
Just head over to your favorite booking site or use one of these sites to research accommodation:

-  `AirBnB <https://www.airbnb.com/>`__
-  `Booking.com <http://www.booking.com/>`__
-  `Hotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>`__

If you need help or advice when considering a specific hotel or apartment, send us an email at prague@writethedocs.org and we'll be happy to help you out.

Where to eat
------------

Prague's culinary culture has made leaps and bounds in recent decades, and now caters to most if not all dietary requirements and tastes.

The typical Czech cuisine, most commonly found in pub-style restaurants, is a simple meat-and-potatoes style, similar to the neighboring countries of Germany, Austria, and Poland.
You can find countless Czech pubs within a short walking distance of the conference venue and all about town.

However, if you are vegetarian, vegan, or prefer a more international selection, here are a few places that our local Praguer, Mikey Ariel, tried and tested and would eat again:

-  `Modry Zub <https://goo.gl/maps/a1iguSbwW9o>`_ - Asian-fusion
-  `MAITREA <https://goo.gl/maps/d3GpLZePpuu>`_ - Vegetarian/vegan
-  `La Bodeguita del Medio <https://goo.gl/maps/tw3KSuEWLxC2>`_ - Cuban

Some of these require reservation if you want to dine in a large group.

These are just a few examples, as Prague is packed full of foody options for all budgets, from sidewalk cafes to fast-food stands, bakeries, and supermarkets.

Feel free to poke the Welcome Wagon team if you have any questions about food in Prague.
