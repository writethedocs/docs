Getting around Sydney
------------------------

Sydney has a network of trains, light rail, buses, and ferries to help you get around the city. Head to the `Transport NSW website <https://transportnsw.info/>`_ to plan your trip.

`Opal <https://transportnsw.info/tickets-opal/opal>`_ is the ticketing system used to pay for all public transport in Sydney.
You’ll need to tap on and off to pay your fare. You can buy Opal cards (as well as single trip tickets) at most train, light rail and ferry stops.

If you’re catching buses, it’s a good idea to buy your ticket in advance, as some routes are `PrePay <https://transportnsw.info/travel-info/ways-to-get-around/bus/opal-only-prepay-only-buses>`_ or ‘Opal only’.
