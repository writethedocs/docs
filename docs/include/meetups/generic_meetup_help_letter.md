# Generic letter asking for help with Meetup

**Subject:** Help with WriteTheDocs

Greetings!

We'd like invite you to join us more actively this coming year!

By helping out, you'll:
* learn more about the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) organization
* have the opportunity to get more involved in the larger US and international WriteTheDocs community
* network with other like-minded professionals
* raise the visibility of the latest techniques and technologies for creating great documentation

Our Write the Docs Meetup group is fortunate to have an active community, experienced organizers, and backing from the Write the Docs organization.

Our current organizer(s) spend a few days a month brainstorming ideas and planning the events. We are asking for your help with the planning and/or activities such as:
* networking with other tech and Meetup groups
* finding interesting content
* recruiting speakers
* occasionally hosting Meetup events

Helping out is a great opportunity for everyone. If you're new to the field, it's a great way to learn, network, and develop new skills. For more experienced documentarians, it's an opportunity to share your stories and expertise, refresh your skills, and discuss challenges with other writers.

Getting a fresh perspective will help us continue building on an already great group. If you're interested, let us know.

Hope to see you soon!
