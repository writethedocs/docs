Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have mailing lists for our Monthly Newsletter, North American Conferences, and European Conferences.
They are low traffic, and only send occasional community and event updates.

You can sign up on our :doc:`/newsletter` page.

Slack
~~~~~

You can join us on the :doc:`/slack` for real-time discussion and to keep in touch with folks from the community.

Slack conversations aren't archived, so we recommend either putting substantial items of interest on the forum,
or moving them there if they develop into something bigger.

Learn more about our :doc:`/slack`.

Job Board
~~~~~~~~~

Write the Docs now has a :doc:`/job-board`.
This is the place to go if you want to find a documentarian job!

We also publicise job posts in our newsletter,
which goes out to over 3,000 recipients.
So you can also stay in the loop that way!

Blog
~~~~~

Check out our :doc:`/blog/index` to see updates from the Community. These will also be sent to the :doc:`/newsletter`.

Twitter
~~~~~~~

We're pretty active on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/hashtag/writethedocs?f=tweets&vertical=default&lang=en>`_. You can follow the **#writethedocs** hashtag to see community tweets.
