I want to run a Write the Docs conference, now what?
====================================================

We have a few guidelines that you should always adhere to when thinking about
starting your own Write the Docs event:

* **You must already have attended a Write the Docs conference.**

  We do this to ensure that you know what a "Write the Docs event" means, for
  better or for worse. We run these events as not-for-profit experiments where
  we try to isolate the things that work well and avoid anything that degrades
  the experience. We take risks where others might be cautious, we focus on
  shared social experiences, and we do our best to make a difference in the
  community.

  Reading about this philosophy second-hand just doesn't convey the full scope
  of how we operate. Therefore, personally attending and experiencing our
  community is key in understanding how our community works so that you can
  carry the message forward when you organize an event.

* **You must have an established Write the Docs organizer mentor.**

  We run Write the Docs events on a franchise model, where the local team is in
  control. They arrange the schedule, scope out the venue, plan the parties, and
  take care of anything else. This gives the event a local feel
  which is part of what makes it special: if you attend Write the Docs USA and
  Write the Docs Europe you will find significant differences -- and that is
  intentional.

  However, to ensure some basic consistency between the different events in
  philosophy and structure, newcomers will be assigned a mentor from one of our
  long-time organizers who can provide guidance and answer any questions that might
  arise.

* **Remember that organizing events is hard.**

  There are many people that would love to run a Write the Docs event, but it is
  important to realize that can be harder than it looks. If you are going to run
  a Write the Docs event, you need to understand what it means to the community,
  to the people who spend time and money coming to our events, and to the people
  who spend hours preparing talks and tutorials.

`Reach out to us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`__, and we will help as much as
we can and you want -- we want more Write the Docs events to happen all over the world.
