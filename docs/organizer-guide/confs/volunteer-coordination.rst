Volunteers coordination
=======================

Write the Docs conferences lean heavily on volunteers. Around 10 to 15
volunteers support the organisers, coordinated by the volunteer coordinator.

The volunteer coordinator is responsible for recruiting volunteers, drafting
a schedule, and supporting the volunteers during the conference. The latter
includes ensuring all volunteers know where to go and when, have enough
information on their tasks, and handle any incidents, like a volunteer being
ill.

The volunteer coordinator is typically also the on-site registration manager,
as these roles closely overlap.

There are :doc:`several roles for volunteers <volunteer-roles>`, each split
into several shifts that have one or two people assigned.

Call for Volunteers
-------------------

The call for volunteers (CFV) typically starts when registration opens.
About 2-3 months before the conference, the CFV closes, and volunteers
are selected. Selection criteria include having a mix of volunteers with
previous experience and those with no experience, and may also depend
on the availability of volunteers.

Once volunteers are selected, send the `Welcome and Confirmation`_ email.
Typically, not everyone is still available by this time.

Once volunteers are confirmed, create a Slack channel with all volunteers
for this conference. This helps communication between volunteers.

Ideally, volunteers should be selected before tickets sell out.
If this is not possible, applicants should be reassured that a ticket
will still be available for them. All confirmed volunteers receive
a free ticket for the conference. If they had already purchased a
ticket, their purchase can be refunded.

Scheduling
----------

Based on a final list of confirmed volunteers, their role preferences and
their availability, create a draft schedule.

For the schedule, when possible:

* Spread shifts fairly over different volunteers.
* Assign volunteers to varied roles, unless they have a preference for
  having a particular role.
* Try not to schedule the same person for the same shift twice in a row,
  unless they want to.
* Registration/info is one of the lonelier and complex tasks, and can have
  very busy moments on the first mornings of the conference. Try to
  schedule someone that already has organising or volunteering experience,
  sharing with someone who does not. The latter person can then be scheduled
  for a two-person shift later, reducing the amount of training the volunteer
  coordinator has to do.
* Balance the late and early shifts, particularly the social event. Someone
  who has the late shift in the social event should not be scheduled for a
  9 AM shift the next day, if possible.
* If volunteers would like to see a particular speaker, it doesn't mean they
  can't be scheduled for that shift - they can be scheduled as talk timing
  or speaker coordinator and still see that speaker.
* Coordinate a specific meeting time and place for pre-conference setup
  volunteers, as this is not always obvious. Especially if they are not
  joining the pre-conference hike or boat ride.

Once you have a draft schedule, send the `Roles, Draft Schedule, and Registration`_
email. Some people may have forgotten scheduling limitations, so changes may
still be needed. Once the schedule is final, send the
`Final Schedule and Code of Conduct`_ email.

During the conference
---------------------

During the conference, the volunteer coordinator should support the volunteers,
and handle any incidents. Some volunteers are very proactive and have previous
experience, so they easily figure out what to do. Some have never attended a
conference before, and are more insecure about their roles. Each will need
different types of support.

Some particular points of attention:

* Try to make it clear that you are there to support the volunteers, and
  that they should feel free to ask anything they are not sure about at
  any time. Having a Slack channel for volunteers helps for this.
* Some volunteers will need more guidance on their roles than others.
  Try to make sure that all volunteers have enough information to feel
  confident in their roles. This is less of an issue for roles like the
  writing day volunteer, as they have the writing day coordinator to guide
  them in what to do.
* Encourage volunteers, particularly those who are very committed to their
  roles, to take sufficient breaks and eat and drink enough. For example,
  if there is only one volunteer on registration shift, check in on them
  periodically, and cover for a few minutes if needed. The floater can
  also do this.
* Registration is typically the most time pressing and complex task,
  particularly in the mornings where many attendees register at the same
  time. Be available at registration to make sure things are running
  smoothly, because this is when the most questions typically arise.
* Check in on the volunteers from time to time, and see if they need anything.

After the conference
--------------------

After the conference, send the `Thank you and Feedback`_ email.
