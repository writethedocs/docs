Write the Docs Newsletter
#########################

At the beginning of every month, we put out an email newsletter to the community. It's built around a handful of stories that we capture and write-up from the Slack team, and also includes an overview of what the org team is working on and a calendar listing of upcoming events.

In this doc, we'll cover all of the pieces that go into putting the newsletter out each month.

Tag stories in Slack (throughout the month)
********************************************

The newsletter team keeps an eye on the WTD Slack and flags conversations they think might be a good fit by tagging them with the ``:newsletter:`` emoji. We've added the 'Reacji Channeler' plug-in to automatically send the tagged post to the #newsletter-slushpile channel.

The editor will have the slushpile channel set to send notifications, so they have a chance to copy and paste conversation into a txt file locally. (So nothing gets swallowed up by the Slack limit.)

We look for a variety of conversations topics, and usually end up capturing ~10 or so, from which we end up picking 4.

Some of the things we look for are:

* conversations that yield a lot of practical advice about a topic
* conversations that clearly strike a chord with the audience
* conversations that highlight two sides of a docs problem/topic

Assign stories (7-10 days before shipping)
*******************************************

A week before the planned ship date, the editor will go through the conversations they've captured, and do two things:

* Flag four conversations they think would make good stories (looking for a good balance and some fresh or timely topics).
* Add a copy of all of the conversation to the shared 'Slushpile' dropbox folder.

From there, in the #newsletter channel on Slack, they'll @mention their writers and ask them to pick a story for the month. They'll point them to the slushpile folder so they can have a look, and set a deadline to have drafts back, 2-3 days before shipping.

Assemble & review the newsletter (2-3 days before shipping)
************************************************************

Once all the story drafts have come in, it's time to assemble. They'll start with the ``newsletter-TEMPLATE-2017.rst`` document, and start to fill it in.

The top section is an Editor's letter, which just serves as a quick greeting and introduction, and touches on any big things happening in the community during the month. This usually clocks in at 100-150 words.

Next comes the stories. They should be edited for length and clarity and tone, as well as to make sure they've followed the :doc:`editorial-guidelines`.

Finally, the upcoming events sections covers any upcmoing community events or conferences, and then lists out any meetups that are scheduled for the next month. It's important to include any meetups that happen in the first week or so of the following month, since the newsletter doesn't usually go out right on the first.

Get a list of current meetup events from http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/events .

When the content for the newsletter is all in place, upload the file to a new branch on GitHub in ``www/docs/blog``. Create a pull request and share in the #newsletter channel for review.

Allow 1-2 days for folks to review and leave comments. (Not *everyone* has to review it, but 2-3 sets of extra eyeballs is ideal.)

Resolve all comments, and then when you're ready to send it, merge your Pull Request (which will take it live on the WTD site).
