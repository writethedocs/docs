Meetups FAQ
===========

The following list of questions and answers cover some issues that you might
encounter when you want to `start a meetup <http://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/>`_.

Can Write the Docs cover the Meetup.com fees?
---------------------------------------------

Yes! We can cover the website fees for active meetups, or for new meetups on a trial-period basis.

New meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to start a new meetup group but need assistance with the fees, please `contact us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ **before** you create the meetup group, so that we can create the group directly from the Write the Docs organization account. The trial period lasts for 3 months, which should give you enough time to establish a local presence and hopefully run your first meetup.

After 3 months we will examine the state of the new meetup group to determine the following criteria:

* Whether the first meetup was well-attended and generated a potential for future meetups. As a rule of thumb, an "active" meetup group runs at least 1 meeup per quarter (or 4 meetups per year).
* How many members are in the meetup group. The minimum number might change depending on which city/country the meetup is located, but generally between 20-50 members in most major cities can be expected after the first 3 months.

Existing meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already started a meetup group yourself and successfully ran several well-attended meetups, you can `contact us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ and we will take over the meetup fees. To transfer ownership of the meetup group, you use the `Step down as organizer <https://www.meetup.com/help/topics/19/article/465025/>`_ process and nominate the Write the Docs account as new organizer. After the transfer, we will assign you the co-organizer role, which lets you have full control over the specific meetup group without handling finances or global operations.

Basic vs. Unlimited meetup subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Basic subscription allows your group a maximum of 50 members and 4 organizers, while Unlimited subscription has no limits for members and organizers. If you anticipate less than 50 members for your meetup group, a Basic subscription may be suitable. If you anticipate over 50 members, an Unlimited subscription may be a better option.

Some Write the Docs meetup groups have started with the Basic subscription plan and have grown quickly. When the meetup exceeds over 50 members, Meetup prompts the organizer to upgrade to the Unlimited plan. If you upgrade right away, you will not be charged at the Unlimited rate until your subscription renewal date. 

Can a company sponsor a local meetup?
-------------------------------------

Yes, as long as the sponsoring company or organization adheres to the following guidelines:

* If a company wishes to host a meetup at their offices, the meetup must be open to all documentarians, regardless of whether they are employed at the host company.

* We recommend that companies handle their sponsorship contributions directly. For example, if a company wishes to sponsor equipment for streaming or recording talks, we advise that the company maintain the equipment and operate it during each meetup.

* Sponsorship contributions should be directly proportionate to the needs of the meetup. Our meetups are not-for-profit and also reflect the `Write the Docs worldview <http://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/#write-the-docs-worldview>`_. This means that aggressive recruitement techniques and other marketing-heavy actions during the meetup will be considered a violation of our `Code of Conduct <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_.

* If you have any questions regarding a specific sponsorship offer or request, please do not hesitate to `email us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ or ask a question in the #meetup-organisers channel on our Slack.

Anything else I get for organizing a meetup?
--------------------------------------------

We give each meetup a ticket to a Write the Docs conference for one of the organizers as a way to say thanks.

We give North American meetups a ticket to the NA conference,
and European meetups a ticket to the EU conference.
If you're on another continent,
you can have one for which ever makes more sense for your group!

Sharing Meetup Duties
---------------------

The Meetup interface allows you to set up multiple organizers in a `Leadership Team <https://www.meetup.com/help/article/868703/>`_.

Different members of your leadership team can:

* Find speakers
* Set up meetup locations
* Handle meetup logistics, as described in

If you have a Twitter account for your meetup, you can share access through `TweetDeck <https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/>`.

Log in with your Meetup Twitter account, select the Accounts link (in the left hand navigation bar), and selet Manage Team. You should be able to add the Twitter accounts of other organizers there.
