Welcome to the Write the Docs Community
=======================================

**Write the Docs** is a series of conferences and local meetups focused on all things related to software documentation.

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
:doc:`documentarians` to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the **art and science of documentation**.

Team
----

Write the Docs wouldn't be possible without our wonderful :doc:`/team` of volunteers.
We are always looking for folks who want to take a stronger leadership role in our community.
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in helping on a conference,
or in our community in general.

Stay Connected

Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have mailing lists for our Monthly Newsletter,
North American Conferences,
and European Conferences.
They are low traffic,
and only send occasional community and event updates.

You can sign up in our sidebar.

Meetups
~~~~~~~

We have meetups in multiple cities every month.
The :doc:`/meetups/index` page has more information.

Slack
~~~~~

You can join us on the :doc:`/slack` for real-time discussion and to keep in touch with folks from the community.

Slack conversations aren't archived, so we recommend either putting substantial items of interest on the forum,
or moving them there if they develop into something bigger.

Learn more about our :doc:`/slack`.

Forum
~~~~~

Check out our `Forum <http://forum.writethedocs.org/>`__ to keep in
touch with your fellow documentarians.

The forum is the place to start discussions that we should keep around for a while. If a Slack conversation
starts to get a lot of attention and seems like something of permanent interest, we suggest that you move it
over to the forum.
