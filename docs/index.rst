**Write the Docs Portland is happening now!** Jump to the :doc:`schedule <conf/portland/2018/schedule>` or join the :doc:`livestream <conf/portland/2018/livestream>`!

Welcome to our community!
=========================

**Write the Docs** is a global community of people who care about documentation. Our primary gathering places are:

* :doc:`Our slack network </slack>` with thousands of members
* :doc:`Conferences </conf/index>` on 3 continents
* :doc:`Local meetups </meetups/index>` in over 30 cities

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
:doc:`documentarians` to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the **art and science of documentation**.
