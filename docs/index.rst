The conference
--------------

We'll be holding the first version of Write the Docs, the conference, in Portland, OR in early April 2013. This will bring together the community of documentarians into a room, for a number of reasons. We hope to help people discover a sense of community, to introduce new and interesting approaches and ideas, and generally have a meeting of the minds around documentation.
