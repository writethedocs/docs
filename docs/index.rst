Welcome
=======

Write the Docs is a place where the art of documentation can be practiced and appreciated. There are a lot of people out there that write docs, but there isn't a good place to go to find good information, ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of documentatarians. We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high quality information about the art of writing documentation. Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome people out there writing documentation.

The conference
--------------

We'll be holding the first version of Write the Docs, the conference, in Portland, OR in early April 2013. This will bring together the community of documentarians into a room, for a number of reasons. We hope to help people discover a sense of community, to introduce new and interesting approaches and ideas, and generally have a meeting of the minds around documentation.
