Welcome
=======

Write the Docs is a place where the art and science of documentation can be
practiced and appreciated.
There are a lot of people out there who write docs,
but there isn't a good place to go to find information,
ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of documenters.
We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high quality
information about the art of writing documentation.
Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome
people out there writing documentation.

.. note:: The website for Write the Docs Conference and Meetups is located
    at http://conf.writethedocs.org/
