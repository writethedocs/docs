Ticket Update, Call for Volunteers, Job Fair
============================================

Greetings, fellow documentarians! The Prague conference is less than three months away, and we can't wait to see you all soon! Here are the latest updates from the conference team to help you prepare.

**Tickets are selling fast!** We are not sold out yet, but our European community is showing great enthusiasm, and we expect to have another wave of registrations after we announce the presentations soon, so you might want to beat the rush and `get your ticket now <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-prague-2018>`_.

Call for volunteers
-------------------

There is plenty to do during the conference and volunteers are essential to the success of all our events! We are looking for folks who are willing to help out during the conference. If you volunteer for two or more shifts (at an average of three hours each), you will receive a free ticket for the conference.

We are looking for folks to help out in these roles:

- **Venue set up** - Prepping the main conference hall on Saturday (after the boat ride), including preparing the registration desk, laying out swag, arranging writing day boards, and other light physical labor
- **Writing day** - Assisting the Writing Day coordinator, including general information inquiries, directing attendees to specific tables, helping writing day project leads with logistical questions, and other duties as assigned
- **Registration desk/Info** - Registering people in the main conference hall and answering any questions
- **Speakers** - Finding speakers and making sure that they're where they need to be when it comes time to speak
- **Talk Timing** - Keeping track of the length of the talks and warning speakers when they're running out of time
- **A/V and tech support** - Assisting presenters at the time of their greatest need while on stage - issues with slides, video, or audio portions of their presentation. Please apply for this role if you have some A/V knowledge; experience troubleshooting different operating systems is a plus!
- **Floaters** - Other duties as assigned ;) Assisting with odds and ends, requests from other volunteers and organizers, as well as answering questions; overall, being generally helpful
- **Unconference** - Camping out in the unconference area downstairs, keeping the place in order, updating unconference room schedule, and so on
- **Job Fair**- Helping vendors set up their tables before the job fair, or helping with setting the room back for the unconference sessions that follow in the afternoon
- **Venue take down** - Whatâ€™s more fun than setting things up? Taking them down! Helping with taking down the conference set up and leaving the conference hall better than we found it
- **Prague expert** - New this year! If you are a Prague local and would love to share your tips and recommendations or answer questions about places to eat, sightseeing, services, accommodation, or other events that are happening around the conference, we'd love to have you on board!

If you're not entirely sure how to do any of these tasks, don't worry, the organizers will be available for questions and any problems you may encounter. We also have a dedicated volunteer coordinator, and some volunteers from previous years will join us again, so you will have support.

To register as a volunteer for the conference, please read and fill out the `Call for Volunteers form <https://goo.gl/forms/335d8VDgzx2M9ZDm1>`_. You will receive additional information by mid-July regarding shifts, detailed duties, and other updates to the volunteer duties and schedules.

Please email our volunteer coordinator Sasha Romijn at wtd@mxsasha.eu if you have any questions about volunteering for the conference.
