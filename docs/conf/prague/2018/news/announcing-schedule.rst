Announcing Full Schedule & Tickets Sold Out
===========================================

Greetings, documentarians!

We're just under a month out from the Prague conference and we hope you're all excited!
We're writing today to announce that we are officially sold out at capacity, and to share with you the full talk schedule and other interesting tidbits that you might need to know.

In the meantime, if it's your first Write the Docs, now's a great time to check out `the Welcome Wagon page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/welcome-wagon/>`_, which has lots of great info to help you get oriented.
And whether it's your first or fifth conference, it's never too early to check out the `Explore Prague
<https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/visiting/>`_ page for inspiration on how to make the most of your visit.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

Parallel to the conference talks, we will run the unconference **all day on Monday and in the afternoon on Tuesday**. On Tuesday morning the unconference room will be converted to the **job fair**, where you can meet companies who care about content and find out about documentarian-friendly jobs all around Europe and the world.

We'll also have a round of lightning talks after lunch on each conference day.
You'll be able to sign up for unconference sessions and lightning talks during the conference.

Tickets are sold out!
---------------------

Each year we are excited to see a growing interest from our European community, which leads to tickets selling out earlier. We have now reached capacity at the venue, so we had to close ticket sales. If you didn't get a chance to get your ticket, please do consider joining us at one of our other events! You can see the full list of our conferences on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/>`_.

Start Thinking About Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday again this year.
We're looking forward to receiving your project ideas, and you can also check out our annual 'Write Write the Docs' sprint on the Write the Docs website.

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, drop us an email at `prague@writethedocs.org <mailto:prague@writethedocs.org>`_.
Or just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm so far â€“ we're so excited to see you all next month!

The Write the Docs team
