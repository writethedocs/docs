Highlights and thanks from the Prague conference
------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone,

As we are wrapping up the Prague conference, we wanted to send out a quick email to thank everyone for helping to make our fifth European conference such a success.
Whether you joined us in person or watched from afar, we thought you might like to get some of the highlights!

Conference recap
================

At over 250 people, this year's conference was our biggest European event to date!
We had the usual mix of main stage and lightning talks, unconference sessions, writing sprints, and social events.
We were also pleased with the success of some new experiments, including livestreaming the talks, running real-time captioning for the main stage, and hosting an in-person job fair.
We received a lot of positive feedback on all of these and are excited to carry them forward to future events.

We also had some interesting feedback on some things we might improve for next time.
The writing day, for example, picked up a lot of interest this year, and we're now looking at providing more in-depth guidance on how to get the most out of the sessions.

Overall, we were so excited to see another conference come together and see our awesome community gather under one roof.

Videos and photos

Videos of all the talks are now available `in our video archive <https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/prague/2018/>`__.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website, conference booklet, and in posters around the conference venue.
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in announcements on the stage.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event, and therefore attendees should drink responsibly.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

We still have our second `Australia conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/>`__ in November.
Tickets are still available and the list of talks is now published on the website.

Thanks again
============

We're so grateful to our speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and attendees for making this conference possible.
Whether you were able to join us this time or not, we hope to see you back in Prague next year – or even sooner at one of our other events!
