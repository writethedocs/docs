**New this year**: our `Job Fair`_.

Concept
=======

Write the Docs (http://www.writethedocs.org/) is a
**three day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

We hold two conferences yearly, one in Portland, USA in May, and one in
Prague, Europe in September. Attendence is approximately 400 in the
USA and 250 in Europe, and we expect both conferences to sell out.

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical Writers (50%)
- Developers (15%)
- Support Staff (15%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard to keep ticket
prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your sponsorship makes it
possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events, whether they're a
freelancer, a student or out of work. Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your
commitment to and support of good documentation, and the people who build it.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What are the table sizes? What is included?
-------------------------------------------

The small sponsorship table is a 6' table, and the large is two 6' tables. These are not standard conference expo halls, but in the main conference venue, so please don't bring anything that will need to be hung or expand more than 2 feet beyond the edge of your area. Wifi & Power will be provided.

What are the dates that sponsors need to know about?
----------------------------------------------------

* PRIOR: Two weeks prior to the event, you are able to start shipping items for the conference. Please inquire about the address to ship things to.

* SUNDAY: Sponsor setup will be available on Sunday from 10am-4pm. Please contact us to coordinate a time to make sure that we're available to assist you when you arrive.

* MONDAY: Doors will open at 8am, so we recommend arriving at this time to get the most visibility with attendees. This is the official start of the conference, when sponsors tables will need to be staffed. The conference will run until around 5pm

* TUESDAY: Tear down will be 3pm on Tuesday. That will be the end of the conference, so feel free to book travel home that evening. We'll also be having a local meetup social and conference after party at New Relic that evening, which you're also welcome to come to.
