Hello everyone,

Since our :doc:`first announcement </conf/prague/2020/news/prg-covid-19-update-01>` two weeks ago, we've been following the COVID-19 updates from the relevant authorities. At the time of writing this update, Czech Republic is still under lockdown and the government predicts that this situation will continue for at least a month.

Given the uncertainty of the long-term impact of this situation, we have decided to **postpone the Call for Proposals and ticket sales until at least 1st May, 2020**. We hope that by then we will have more information to determine whether to proceed with the conference on the original dates, postpone the conference, or cancel the conference altogether.

The true power of community comes in the most trying of times. It's been amazing watching folks come together on :doc:`Slack </slack>`, and we're trying to plan more ways for folks to feel connected and supported. We are grateful to have such a supportive and flexible community, and we're sending positive thoughts to all our documentarians, as well as other communities that have been forced to cancel or postpone their events.

You can check the following resources for up-to-date information about Czech Republic and Europe:

- `WHO Regional office for Europe <http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19>`_

We are watching the situation closely and will send another update as more information becomes available. You can find all our COVID-19 updates in our `tagged archives </blog/archive/tag/covid-19/>`_.
