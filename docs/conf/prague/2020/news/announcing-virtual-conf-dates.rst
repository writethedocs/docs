Announcing virtual conference dates
===================================

As we :doc:`announced </blog/moving-portland-prague-2020-online>`, Write the Docs Prague 2020 will be a virtual conference.

We decided to move the conference to October, to allow for enough time after the new Portland conference dates in August. The writing day will be on
**{{date.day_two.dotw}}, {{date.day_two.date}}, 10:00-17:00 {{tz}}**,
and the main conference days will be on **{{date.day_three.dotw}}, {{date.day_three.date}}, 10:00-18:00 {{tz}}**.

Ticket sales will re-open in the summer. Check out the :doc:`tickets page </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets>` for prices. Your virtual ticket includes:

* Live streaming of all talks
* Q&A with speakers after each talk (may not be available for all speakers)
* Access to the conference chat with all other attendees, speakers and sponsors
* Access to the writing day
* The virtual job fair

If you have chosen to convert your :doc:`previously bought Portland 2020 ticket </conf/portland/2020/ticket-choices>`
to a virtual pass, you will receive further details by e-mail when we open ticket sales.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities,
who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have drafted a new `sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.

We will still run the `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/job-fair/>`_, helping documentarians
and organizations connect with each other. Check out the sponsorship prospectus for more details and to reserve your spot today.
