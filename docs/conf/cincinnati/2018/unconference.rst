Unconference
============

The unconference at the Cincinnati edition will be a little bit different.
We're devoting an entire day to open discussions, and we'll have reports
from each session so that everybody can learn, even if they can't attend
every session they wanted.

We will put together the full list of topics on Saturday (the day before the unconference). But you can help
your fellow attendees right now by suggesting topics early. To suggest a
topic, you can `submit a pull request against this page <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/master/docs/conf/cincinnati/2018/unconference.rst>`_,
email us at cincinnati@writethedocs.org, or drop a note in the
`#cincinnati <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/cincinnati>`_ 
channel on the
`Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_.
