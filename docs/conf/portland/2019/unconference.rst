Unconference
============

{% include "conf/events/unconference.rst" %}

Unconference sessions are held downstairs from the Crystal Ballroom where the main stage talks are held, in Lola's Room. Because the unconference has become so popular in recent years, we ask session organizers to bear the following guidelines in mind:

* Keep your sessions manageably small. If attendance starts to spill into neighboring tables, consider asking folks to attend an additional session on the same topic.
* If you're leading a session on a popular topic (notably API docs in the past), consider scheduling an early time so there's room to schedule overflow sessions as needed later in the day, or even the next day if the first session is on Monday.
* Ask unconf organizers to help wrangle logistics. Lola's Room can get crowded especially when a popular topic is scheduled.


Unconf organizers (link to us?) are also available to help at any time during the conference. Ask about a topic, ask about the schedule, ask about multiple instances of the same topic -- we want to help you make your unconf session the best it can be. If you can't find us in Lola's room, feel free to seek us out elsewhere. There'll also be a dedicated volunteer who can help.


Schedule

.. FIXME Check unconference schedule

Unconference sessions are held all day Monday, plus Tuesday when the Job Fair isn't running. Exact timing information is available on our :doc:`/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule` page. We'll also post a link to a google sheet with updated unconf session information on this page when the conference starts. Note that you can't sign up on the google sheet, but we keep it updated with information from the signup board.
