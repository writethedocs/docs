Corporate sponsors
------------------

The conference wouldn't be nearly as great as it is without our wonderful corporate sponsors.
Thanks to these folks for supporting the community.

.. raw:: html

    {% macro sponsors() %}
    {% include "include/{{year}}/{{shortcode}}-sponsors.html" %}
    {% endmacro %}
    {{ sponsors()|indent(4) }}

{% endif %}

In Kind Sponsors
----------------

Write the Docs is also helped out by companies that give their employees time to work on the conference.

.. raw:: html

    {% macro inkindsponsors() %}
    {% include "include/{{year}}/{{shortcode}}-sponsors-in-kind.html" %}
    {% endmacro %}
    {{ inkindsponsors()|indent(4) }}
