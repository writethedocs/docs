TensorFlow.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow.org [https://www.tensorflow.org] is Google's open source machine learning platform and one of the most popular projects on GitHub. The website documentation is the primary way that developers learn about TensorFlow and, many times, their first experience with machine learning and AI.

Technical docs are pulled from GitHub [https://github.com/tensorflow/docs] so you'll need a GitHub account. Markdown experience helps, as well as basic familiarity with Jupyter notebooks [https://jupyter.org/] (since many of the guides [https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/quickstart/beginner] can be run and edited in the browser [https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb] using Colab). API reference docs [http://bit.ly/ml4all-docs-sprint] are built from Python docstrings in the TensorFlow source code [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow].

Read the TensorFlow documentation contributors guide [https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs] for workflows and set up. And if you have questions before Writing Day, feel free to ask on the TensorFlow docs mailing list [http://bit.ly/tf-docs-list] or the Gitter channel [https://gitter.im/tensorflow/docs].
