Get Started with AsciiDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing Day sponsor Asciidoctor will maintain a presence throughout the day, eager to support documentarians interested in creating great docs with the Asciidoc markup language. Whether you're already passionate about open source, eager to add a valuable skillset, or just curious, experts in documentation platform development and technical writing with AsciiDoc will be available for tutoring, workshops, and demos:

**Play with AsciiDoc**

You do not have to come with a mission or any sense of commitment. Come to Writing Day, let us learn what you're up to and maybe show you some stuff.

**Convert your docs or get started with AsciiDoc**

Take advantage of AsciiDoc consultants and practitioners to get a head start on migrating to AsciiDoc-based tools or just kick-start a project.

**Learn docs-as-code basics**

We realize not every documentarian has a firm grasp of the docs-as-code approach, what makes it special, and the basic technical hurdles, such as understanding dynamic markup, using code editors, and managing source code with Git. Asciidoctor volunteers are happy to bring you up to speed on the broader docs-as-code approach, even if you don't already have an interest in AsciiDoc. We will meet you at your level and have exercises for learning the ins and outs of popular tools. 

We are maintaining a `GitHub project for all our Write the Docs programming <https://github.com/DocOps/wtd2019>`__. We would love to engage with you there, get feedback on our ideas, and hear how we can make Writing Day more successful for you!


Make Microsoft Docs More Inclusive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make our Microsoft Docs more inclusive; focusing on underrepresented groups and gender neutrality.

TensorFlow.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow.org [https://www.tensorflow.org] is Google's open source machine learning platform and one of the most popular projects on GitHub. The website documentation is the primary way that developers learn about TensorFlow and, many times, their first experience with machine learning and AI.

Technical docs are pulled from GitHub [https://github.com/tensorflow/docs] so you'll need a GitHub account. Markdown experience helps, as well as basic familiarity with Jupyter notebooks [https://jupyter.org/] (since many of the guides [https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/quickstart/beginner] can be run and edited in the browser [https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb] using Colab). API reference docs [http://bit.ly/ml4all-docs-sprint] are built from Python docstrings in the TensorFlow source code [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow].

Read the TensorFlow documentation contributors guide [https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs] for workflows and set up. And if you have questions before Writing Day, feel free to ask on the TensorFlow docs mailing list [http://bit.ly/tf-docs-list] or the Gitter channel [https://gitter.im/tensorflow/docs].

Write CockroachDB Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CockroachDB is the SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.. Here’s a quick overview video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ

Here are a few ways you can contribute to the CockroachDB docs:

**Test our docs**

Give us feedback about clarity, correctness, helpfulness, and ease-of-use by:

- User testing our `Search <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4773>`__
- User testing our `Authorization docs <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4774>`__

**Improve our current docs**

If you love fiddling around with a new product, you can:

- Improve existing docs by `adding missing details <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-missing-info>`__ or `correcting errors <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-incorrect-or-unclear-info>`__
- `Fill gaps <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AA-general+label%3Awtd-writing-day>`__ in our existing docs. If you’d like to dig deeper, we’re missing docs on a handful of important features.
- `Make an easy edit <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Awtd-easy-first-issue+>`__. This is great for those who want to try Git and open their first PR.

Note: Our docs live in `GitHub <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs>`__, so you'll need a GitHub account.

...

Feel free to go through the full list of GitHub issues labeled `wtd-writing-day <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/labels/wtd-writing-day>`__ and claim the ones you want to work on.
And of course, we (`@laurenh <https://writethedocs.slack.com/?redir=%2Fteam%2FU1B2LRTSQ>`__, `@jseldess <https://writethedocs.slack.com/team/U1B2LRTSQ>`__, and `@rmloveland <https://writethedocs.slack.com/?redir=%2Fteam%2FU1B2LRTSQ>`__) will be available throughout the day to help out. Also feel free to reach out to us if you have questions or suggestions in the interim. See you on Writing Day!

Netlify CMS - Give Feedback and Write Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Netlify CMS <https://www.netlifycms.org/>`_ is an open source CMS for static site generators, created by the folks at `Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`_. It works with content stored in Git repositories, so it's great for adding an editor UI to docs-as-code workflows.

We're a really friendly and active community, happy to answer questions in `Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/netlify/netlifyCMS>`_, `Netlify Community <https://community.netlify.com>`_, or even Write the Docs Slack. (Try #static-site-generator or ping @verythorough!) We uphold the Contributor Covenant `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_, and we work hard to make sure all contributors feel welcome, supported, and recognized.

Try it out
^^^^^^^^^^

You can visit the `live demo <https://cms-demo.netlify.com>`_ to play around with a basic version of the editor UI, but for the full tour, we recommend `cloning a sample site <https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/>`_. That way, you can see how your edits in the UI generate commits and pull requests on the connected repository. The featured starter templates use Gatsby, Hugo, and Middleman, but you can use Netlify CMS with almost any static site generator or build tool.

Talk to us about your docs-as-code needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Netlify CMS can be used for all sorts of content, we're focused on making it really great for docs. Come visit the Netlify CMS table, and we can give you a tour of how things work, chat about your docs-as-code workflow, and get your feedback and feature requests.

One of our big projects right now is making Netlify CMS capable of `managing community contributions to open source docs <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/2093>`_, so if you have an open source documentation project you're working on, we'd love to hear about it!

Help write the docs!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're ready to dig into some writing, we've `tagged several issues <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/labels/event%3A%20Write%20the%20Docs>`_ to help get you started:

- `Improve contributing guidelines <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1038>`_, including documentation-specific guidelines and `adding a style guide <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1632>`_.
- `Write a guide for setting up Netlify CMS <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/2092>`_ with your favorite site generator. You can start by following one of the existing guides, then follow that pattern with a new one. Copyediting for existing guide is also appreciated.
- `Create a UI guide <https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/issues/1340>`_ for content editors.

Help improve MDN Web Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`MDN Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org>`_ is a source of references, guides, and tutorials on standards-based web technologies, much loved by web developers. It was chosen as #1 for Documentation in the Developer’s Choice Awards for 2018, conducted by SlashData.

Yet, MDN Web Docs needs help from documentarians—--whether you are a programmer, designer, or someone else who cares about web technology. MDN is a wiki, so anyone can contribute to content. We have tasks for you to help with content about `accessibility <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility>`_, or `web performance <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance>`_, or with `making sure our most-accessed pages are up to editorial standards <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ryTfwcvLOr1b75ekVh590BaJfz_rUo-E_f-jTbSbUU/edit?usp=sharing>`_. If there's another area of web technology that you're passionate about documenting, we welcome that too!
