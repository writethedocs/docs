Announcing virtual conference dates and ticket sales
====================================================

As we :doc:`announced </blog/moving-portland-prague-2020-online>`, Write the Docs Portland 2020 will be a virtual conference.

We decided to keep the dates as previously announced: the writing day is on
**{{date.day_two.dotw}}, {{date.day_two.date}}, 9am-5pm {{tz}}**,
and the main conference days are on **{{date.day_three.dotw}}, {{date.day_three.date}}, 9am-5pm {{tz}}**.

**Ticket sales will re-open on Monday, May 25th**. Check out the :doc:`tickets page </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets>` for prices. Your virtual ticket includes:

* Live streaming of all talks (available for ticket-holders only)
* Q&A with speakers after each talk (may not be available for all speakers)
* Access to the conference chat with all other attendees, speakers and sponsors
* Access to the writing day
* The virtual job fair

If you have chosen to convert your :doc:`previously bought ticket </conf/portland/2020/ticket-choices>` into a
virtual pass, or a pre-order for the virtual Portland 2020 conference, you will receive further
details by e-mail within the next week.

We are aiming to include all our speakers in the virtual conference, but still confirming their availability.

Our opportunity grant will also re-open together with ticket sales in a modified format. Details will be published next week.

Sponsorship update
------------------

We have drafted a new `online sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference.
We are hoping our existing sponsors will be excited about the new benefits,
and are open to new sponsorship requests for this event.
