CFP Reminder, Tickets on Sale, Grant Program
============================================

Happy New Year, documentarians!

As we get ready to start the year, we'd like to remind you that the `call for proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/cfp/>`_ will be open until **January 10th**, and to announce that the `tickets for the conference are officially on sale <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/tickets/>`_. Read on for more details.

Submit your talk by January 10th
--------------------------------

There are still a few days left to submit your proposal! Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/cfp/#submit-your-proposal>`_ for more details about what we are looking for.

And if you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!

We’ll be reviewing all the talk proposals during this month, and will be contacting everyone who submitted a proposal by {{ cfp.notification }}.

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be returning to the Crystal Ballroom on May 3-5, 2020.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer. We're already excited to see what this year has in store!

If you're excited too, go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/tickets/>`_! For the past several years the conference has sold out, so we highly recommend buying early and reserving your spot.

**Please make sure to register for your ticket before you book your travel!** We cannot be responsible for any non-refundable travel costs, and if we reach capacity at the venue before you register, we cannot guarantee a spot for you, even if you booked your travel.

And for those of you who were wondering about a potential East Coast conference: We're currently discussing details about potential cities and venues, and we will announce whether the conference will happen this year as soon as possible.

Grant program
-------------

In previous years, we ran various informal programs for speaker travel assistance and diversity tickets. This year we decided to consolidate and formalize these into a unified grant program for anyone who might need assistance to attend the conference. 

The grant policy will be submitted for community review through our new `Write the Docs Enhancement Proposal (WEP) system <https://github.com/writethedocs/weps>`_, and will include information about selection criteria and other related processes. Stay tuned for more details. 

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We'd like to thank our initial conference sponsors:

* `Microsoft <https://www.microsoft.com/>`_
* `Google <https://www.google.com/>`_
* `Salesforce <https://www.salesforce.com/>`_

If your company is interested in sponsoring one or more conferences, check out `our prospectus for details on the different packages <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ and drop us a line at `sponsorship@writethedocs.org <mailto:sponsorship@writethedocs.org>`_

Once again, we will run the `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/job-fair/>`_, helping documentarians and organizations connect with each other. Check out the sponsorship prospectus for more details and to reserve your spot today. 

Looking forward to seeing you all in Portland!
