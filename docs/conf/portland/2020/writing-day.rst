The Good Docs Project
---------------------

You've just been asked by your team to create documentation for your project. But what kind of document should you create? (An FAQ? A README?) What is supposed to be in it? How do you begin?

 `The Good Docs Project <https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates>`_ can help.

We're working on a set of templates to make it easier to write documentation by suggesting the content needed to create the minimum viable set of documentation for your project. Visit our table if you have new documentation to create, or if you want to try your existing docs against our checklists, or if you just want to talk about templates.
