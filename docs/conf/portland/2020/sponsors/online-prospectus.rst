including new benefits and increased value across our community.

We're excited to work with the organizations in our community to build the best possible event in 2020.
In particular, we would love your feedback on sponsorship levels and benefits.
We expanded the offerings and introduced a lot of new things,
but please let us know if there are other points of interaction with our community that would be valuable for you.
