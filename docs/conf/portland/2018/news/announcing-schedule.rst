Announcing Full Schedule & Last Chance For Tickets
====================================================

Hello everyone!
We're about a month out from the Portland conference and we couldn't be more stoked!
We're writing today to a) announce the full speaker schedule, b) get the ball rolling for Writing Day sprints, and c) encourage you – if you haven't already – to buy your tickets.
We're likely to sell out **in the next day or two**, so `now's your chance <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/tickets/>`_!

In the meantime, if it's your first Write the Docs, now's a great time to check out `the Welcome Wagon page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/welcome-wagon/>`_, which is chockfull of info to help you get oriented.
And whether it's your first or fifth conference, it's never too early to check out the `Explore Portland
<https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/visiting/>`_ page for inspiration on how to make the most of your visit.

Later this month we'll be sending another update that will cover the full details on our social activities, the (exciting new) job fair, and more details about the Writing Day so stay tuned!

Full Presentation Schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

Per usual, we'll be running the unconference downstairs in Lola's room.

This year, it'll be going all-day Monday, starting after the intro talk, and then picking up again Tuesday afternoon, after the job fair.
We'll also have rounds of lightning talks after lunch on both days.
You'll be able to sign up for unconference sessions and lightning talks during the conference

Tickets Nearly Sold Out
-----------------------

We're very nearly at full capacity for the event.
We're not overstating things when we say that tickets will sell out in the next day or two.
Now's the time!
Our `ticket page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/tickets/>`_ is the place!
We look forward to having you join us!

Start Thinking About Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday again this year.
We've got a couple of projects on the docket – including our second annual 'Write Write the Docs' sprint on the WTD website.
But the day is much more fun when folks come with their own projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_.
Or just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!
