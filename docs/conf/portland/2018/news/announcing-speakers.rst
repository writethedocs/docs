Happy Tuesday everybody! 

We're writing today with an update on the fast-approaching Portland conference! 

First off, we're delighted to announce that we've finalized our speakers for the event! Every year talk selection gets more and more difficult as we get a larger, stronger batch of submissions. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a pitch – we literally wouldn't have an event without you! 

We also have some info about ticket purchasing (now's the time!), trip planning (Portland's cool!), and our generous sponsors (want to join them?). Read on for more details! 

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Every year, we look to bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs stage. Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics – with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure. We're really excited about the presentations we're going hear this year – we hope you are too!
