Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
--------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone,

The Write the Docs team is now emerging from the post-conference
recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick email to thank
everyone for helping to make our sixth North American conference such a
success. Whether you joined us in Portland or watched from afar, we
thought you might like to hear some of the highlights!

Conference recap
================

At nearly 450 people, this year's conference was our biggest yet! We had
the usual mix of main stage and lightning talks, unconference sessions,
writing sprints, and social events. We were also pleased with the
success of a couple of new experiments, including livestreaming the
talks, running real-time captioning for the main stage, and hosting an
in-person job fair. We received a lot of positive feedback on all of
these and are excited to carry them forward to future events.

We also had some interesting feedback on some things we might improve
for next time. The unconference, for example, has really found its feet in the
last year or two. With more and more folks participating, we're looking
at providing more in-depth guidance on how to get the most out of the
sessions. We're also considering bringing back ticketed workshops as a way
for attendees to dig a little deeper.

Overall, we were so excited to see another conference come together and
see our awesome community gather out in the physical world.

Videos and photos and write-ups
===============================

Videos of all the talks are now available `in our video
archive <https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2018/>`__. Thanks 
to `Backpedal <https://backpedal.tv/>`__ for doing such a great job with these. 
If you gave a lightning talk, we're working to get
them on our site, but you can see them on 
`YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHplUgfLOLEuHHAm1HdrIyaZ7>`__ 
for now. (You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ>`_ 
so you don't miss any future content!)

We also have photos from the event available on `Flickr <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72157695853045204>`_, 
thanks to our wonderful photographer `Kay <https://twitter.com/goatlady>`_! 
We really love the photos each year, and you're welcome to use them for 
non-commercial purposes, as per our `Creative Commons License <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/>`_.

And finally, several community members have been writing up their
experiences at the conference and sharing them in the `wtd-conferences channel on the Write the Docs
Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/wtd-conferences>`__. If you missed the conference (or are just curious
about how your experience compares to others'), pop in and have a read.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our
`community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__. 
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can. 
None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event. 
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive 
community that we're so lucky to have.

That said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because
nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened.  If there was any personal 
conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations 
of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

Don't forget we have our first joint `Write the Docs + Open Help
conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/>`__ in 
Cincinnati this August, our `Prague conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/>`__ 
again in September, and our first `two-day Australia conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/>`__ 
in November. Both the Cincinnati and Prague events have tickets 
on sale and are actively looking for proposals. 
(The call for the Australia conference will open soon.)

We're also looking for more sponsors to make these conferences just as
magical as the Portland event was. We have a detailed sponsorship
prospectus up for both the `Prague <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ 
and `Cincinnati <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ 
conferences. Get in touch if you have any questions.

Thanks again
============

We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees
for making this conference possible. Whether you were able to come out
this time or not, we hope to see you back in Portland next year – or
even sooner at one of our other events!
