Writing Day
-----------

This year, Write the Docs Europe will have a new Writing Day, modeled after the
concept of
`sprints <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29>`__
from the open source world. The idea is simple: to get a bunch of
interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either
come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone
else's project.

Here are some examples of projects that you might want to work on:

-  Open source software documentation
-  General documentation writing
-  Best practices manual (For your company, or the world)
-  Blog posts
-  Tips and tricks
-  Great works of fiction
-  Love letters
-  The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

All this adds up to a room full of smart people sharing your problems,
your passion, and your goals. So be ready to learn some new things and
to teach others what you know.

Even if you `feel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome>`__ as
though you don't know that much, we know you have a lot to offer. Come
surprise yourself with how much you can share.

Logistics
^^^^^^^^^

Please bring a computer or some other mechanism with which to create
written words.

We'll be creating and editing content, so make sure that you have the
tools you need to contribute.

Schedule
^^^^^^^^

Full schedule and venue information will be published soon!

Documenting a new project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check out our `beginners
guide <http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs//>`__

some ideas for how you can contribute to a project that you love.

Projects
^^^^^^^^

We have some suggestions for projects that you can work on during the
Writing Day. If you'd like to add your own project to the list, you can
`email us <mailto:prague@writethedocs.org>`__. Better yet, `submit a pull
request <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/master/docs/conf/na/2016/writing-day.rst>`__.

`Write the Docs Website <http://www.writethedocs.org>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

We have a website for our community, but it kinda sucks. Help us make it
better by adding content, archiving old talks and notes, or just making
it more friendly in general. Remember, you *are* the community.

`Write the Docs Guide <http://docs.writethedocs.org/>`__
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A guide to writing documentation. Help us make this guide great for
people who want to write docs, but don't know where to start.

The Mechanics of Writing
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Collaborate on best-practices, guidance, and advice for reducing
contributor friction, file/repository organization, and tooling for
documentation for  different kinds of projects. Optionally build
functional examples and hack on tools.

Your Project Here
'''''''''''''''''

Yup. We know you need better docs. We do too. Make it happen.

Send us an email or pull request with your project and a short paragraph
about what you need help with, and we'll include it here.
