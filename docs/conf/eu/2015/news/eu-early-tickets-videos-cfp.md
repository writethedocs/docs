# Early-Bird Tickets Sell Out, Videos, and Proposal Reminder

The [conference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/) is less than 3 months away, and we're happy to see such 
an overwhelmingly positive and supportive response from our documentarians
all over the world.

Here are some updates that you might like to know as the Call for Proposals
draws to a close and ticket sales are in full swing.

## Call for Proposals Reminder

If you haven't submitted your proposal yet, you still have until the [Call
for Proposals](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/cfp/) ends **Tomorrow, June 15th Midnight CET**.

Our community is full of amazing people, and we'd love to have you come and 
share your experiences with us. We will be announcing the conference program on **July 1st, 2015**.

## Early-Bird Tickets Sold Out

Both corporate and independent early-bird tickets have sold out. 
Thanks to everyone who has already purchased a ticket. Regular independent
and corporate tickets are now available. 

We do expect the conference to sell out fully, so 
[buy your tickets](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-eu-2015/) today.

## Videos from Write the Docs Europe 2014

We're happy to announce that the videos from last year's Write the Docs Europe
are live! We compiled the videos into a [playlist on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpnHBLE4qEUwg1LjhDZEvC2A), and we thank all our speakers
from last year for your inspiring talks!

## Conclusion

We are putting the finishing touches on all the other aspects of the
event. Expect to hear more about the conference party, schedule, reception, and more
in the next few weeks.
