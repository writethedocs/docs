# Announcing Ticket Sales and Extended Call for Proposals


We're happy to announce that early-bird tickets are now on sale, and that we've 
extended our call for proposals following the excitement from our North America documentarians
after our [latest conference in Portland ](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/).

## Tickets

As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for
everyone. Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.

Tickets are **on sale now**. [Buy them now](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#tickets).

Early Bird tickets are limited in number.
We budget for a set amount,
and don't have a deadline for them running out.

### Corporate Tickets

Companies interested in sponsorship can also receive tickets to the
conference with a [sponsorship package](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#sponsors).

### Independent Tickets

Purchase this ticket if you are paying for yourself, work at a
non-profit, or at a company with less than 10 employees.

## Extended Call for Proposals

Our North America conference seemed to inspire many of our documentarians to create
proposals for our European conference. Therefore, we've extended the deadline to submit
your proposal to **Midnight CET on June 15**.

Head over to our [Call for Proposals](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/cfp) for more information, and to submit your
talk.
