Announcing Talks Schedule
=========================

Our website is now updated with the `final schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/schedule/>`_ for the talks, so you can start planning your time at the conference. Check out the `Sessions <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/speakers/>`_ page for full descriptions of the talks.

You can also sign up for unconference sessions during the conference, as well as bring your own Writing Day project or lightning talk. We will be posting the pre-selected unconference sessions on the board at the entrance to the unconference room.

Welcome Wagon
-------------

We always try to over-document the conference for our attendees. Our `Welcome Wagon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/welcome-wagon/>`_ guide is full of information about the conference, and we recommend that you check it out!

Last Tickets Available
----------------------

Last `tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/tickets>`_ are still available, but don't wait too long, as we are in the final stages of crunching numbers to make sure that everyone who registered has a badge and swag!

Welcome to Our Newest Sponsors
------------------------------

This conference wouldn't happen without the help of our amazing sponsors. Please join us in giving a warm welcome to `Mozilla <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>`_, our latest supporting organization.

We still have lots of exciting opportunities for sponsorship, if your company is looking for ways to support good documentation. Drop us an email at at sponsorship@writethedocs.org with any questions.

See you all soon in Prague!
