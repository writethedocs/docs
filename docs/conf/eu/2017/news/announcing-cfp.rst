Announcing our Call for Proposals
==================================

We're all pretty excited about `Write the Docs Portland 2017
<https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/>`_, which means it is an excellent
time to announce the call for proposals for `Write the Docs Prague 2017
<https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/>`_, which is a little under five
months away!

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come
up on stage to share their insights and experience. Whether you’ve been writing
documentation for decades or you’ve just started, we want to hear from you!

The `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/cfp/>`_, has a
couple of changes this year, we're making all talks 30 minutes long, and
we're also taking proposals for unconference sessions!

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our
inspiring community of documentarians. If there is something you’d really like
to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who
would be good!

You can read our full `Call for
Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/cfp/>`__ on the website.
The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight PST 31st May** this year.
