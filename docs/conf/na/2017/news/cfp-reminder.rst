Call for Proposals Reminder
===========================

Good day to you, fellow documentarians!

The conference is now a little over three months away, so we hope you’re getting geared up for another inimitable Write the Docs experience in lovely Portland, Oregon!

`Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/tickets>`_ are selling quickly – thanks to everyone who has already purchased theirs! We do expect the conference to sell out fully again this year, so don't drag your heels!

Submit your talk by Friday
--------------------------

Although the deadline is fast approaching, there is still time to submit a talk proposal for Write the Docs North America! We'll be accepting proposals until Friday February 10th at Midnight PST.

Also, if you're interested in pitching a talk, but you need some ideas or guidance, check out our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/cfp/>`_ page. If you've got an idea, but you're having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on Slack. Your fellow documentarians are there to help!

We can't wait to see your submissions! We'll be reviewing all the talk proposals later this month, and announcing the full conference schedule in early March.

Welcome and thanks to our first 2017 sponsors
---------------------------------------------

This conference wouldn't happen without the help of our amazing sponsors. So far we're very grateful to have `Google <https://www.google.com/about/>`_ and `Sticker Mule <https://www.stickermule.com/>`_ join us as sponsors for this year's conference.

We still have lots of exciting opportunities for sponsorship, if your company is looking for ways to support good documentation. Drop us an email at at sponsorship@writethedocs.org with any questions.

Thanks so much for your help in making Write the Docs possible!

More details coming soon
------------------------

We are currently hammering out the last details for this year's event. Expect to hear more about the hike, writing day, unconf, party, reception, and more in the next few weeks. It's always so thrilling for us to see how the conference improves and evolves – this year will be no exception.
