Thanks for coming to Write the Docs Portland 2017
=================================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our fifth Write the Docs Portland conference! We're
so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for
making the conference possible.

We hope you had a wonderful time, and that you are as excited as we are
about the beautiful community that gathers under our roof. Below
we've included all of the resources you might need for staying in touch
on the Write the Docs Slack. We also have a short anonymous survey for
you to fill out, so we can make the conference even better next year.

Tell us how we did
------------------

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We
really appreciate your candid feedback!

**Our two question survey is quick and easy**, so `go fill it
out <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelyB5VilarOBMw53yYiElV40h6PfryJpInvgPU6Ub3TfsOZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>`__.

Speak or Sponsor in Prague
--------------------------

Don't forget we have our Prague conference this year! The
`Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/cfp/>`__
is open until **May 31**.

We're also looking for more sponsors to make the Prague event just as
magical as this year's Portland event. If you are curious about
sponsoring any Write the Docs event, please contact us at
sponsorship@writethedocs.org.

You can find information about the conference and Call for Proposals on
our `Prague Conference
website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/>`__.

Videos of the talks will be posted in the next few weeks. We'll send
another update once they're out and ready to be watched.

Write the Docs Slack
--------------------

The Write the Docs Slack has really grown more this last year. Our
general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading
up to the conference, and we hope that y'all continue the conversations
throughout the year. If you haven't joined, head on over and join us!
We're at `Write the Docs Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.com/>`__.

Meetups
-------

We hope you continue to `build the
community <https://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/>`__ and keep in touch
with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a
number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your
city `listed <https://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/>`__, consider
`starting <https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/>`__
a meetup!

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can
spread the word.

Thanks again
------------

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great
experience. Thanks for making it another wonderful year. We hope to see
you back again next year, or even sooner at one of our other events that
happen throughout the year.
