Welcome to Write the Docs
=========================

Hello Documentarians,

The conference is just a few days away. 
We have some reminders, late-breaking information, and a few thanks to share with you all.

Here's the quick summary: Come to the Crystal Ballroom whenever you get in Sunday,
we'll be there doing a few different events.
You can get your badge early,
learn from other documentarians,
and get into the swing of the event.
Then join us again at the Crystal Ballroom Monday morning for the main conference.
The [Schedule](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/schedule/) has all the details of dates and times.

Read on for a collection of information that might be useful for your planning. See you soon!

Important Conference Details
----------------------------

* **Riding the trains**. Be aware that TriMet, Portland's public transit system, will be working on the light rail lines. This means that you can't easily get from the Airport to downtown without a transfer. Public transit is generally excellent in Portland, but trains might be crowded, and schedules will be limited. For more information, see our [visiting page](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/visiting/#the-max) and [the TriMet website](https://trimet.org/alerts/morrisonyamhill/).
* **Riding a bike**. Portland has a fancy new [bike share program](https://www.biketownpdx.com/), and they've given us a discount code for you. You can use `WRITE17` for half off your first day pass.
* **Walking a trail**. If you're planning to join us for the [hike](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/hike/) on Saturday at *2pm*, make sure that you've already got a ticket. It looks like it will probably rain a little, so make sure you have a rain jacket!
* **Read the [Welcome Wagon Guide](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/welcome-wagon/)**. It is packed full of information on how to get the most out of the conference.
* **Join us on Sunday at the Crystal Ballroom for the Writing Day, Workshops, and the Reception.** The [Writing Day](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/writing-day/) is open to everyone, and runs from *9am-6pm*, immediately followed by the Reception from *6pm-8:30pm*. The [Workshops](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/workshops/) run from 9-5, are ticketed separately, and are sold out. **All events are at the Crystal Ballroom.** At the Reception, you can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts. **Plan to come to the Crystal ballroom whenever you get in on Sunday.**
* **Follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/)**. We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events. Our code of conduct boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the [full text](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) is also available. Our cell phone numbers and email addresses are on that page if you ever need to contact us.
* **Plan a [lightning talk](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/lightning-talks/)**. We'll have lightning talks each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Plan a discussion**. We'll be running the [Unconference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/unconference/) in the afternoon on Monday and all day Tuesday. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a very specific thing? This is the place. We'll have a sign-up board so you know what's happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
* **Come to the party on Monday night.** This is a private party just for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We'll be at [Jack Knife](https://goo.gl/maps/UF1PgcfKWNS2), 614 SW 11th Ave, with light food and drinks.
* **A small schedule change**. The person who was scheduled to be our last speaker has had to cancel because of a family emergency. We'll be adding another set of lightning talks during this time, because we always have more than we have time for. Sorry about that! We'll still be having conversations after that, and our [post-conference social meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-PDX/events/239146623/) is still happening.
* **Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided.** Don't worry about coffee before you come to the conference on Monday or Tuesday. Coffee and breakfast are served at 8:15, and the conference starts at 9. We have [published a list of the food](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/venue/#dietary-requirements) that we'll be serving, which might help with your meal planning.
* **Use the hashtag [#writethedocs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs&src=tyah).** Twitter is a great way to communicate at the conference. If you arrive into Portland early and want to find others, use the hashtag or tweet at @writethedocs. We can point you to something good.
