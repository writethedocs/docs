Workshops
=========

This year we are launching workshops, a new activity type inspired once again by our friends at various open-source software conferences. The workshops will be held during the writing day, in dedicated rooms in the conference venue.

The main goal of the workshops is to bring together folks who are interested to learn from different experts in relevant fields in a focused environment.

- Date & Time: **Sunday, May 14th, 9am-5pm**
- Location: **Crystal Ballroom, 1332 W Burnside St**. We will be in Lola's Room (on the second floor).

What can I learn in the workshops?
----------------------------------

This year we have two workshops, one that covers writing related topics and one that covers development related topics.

For specific information about this year's topics, see the `Sessions page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/speakers/>`_. The workshop sessions are labeled with a "Workshop" prefix.

Based on feedback and demand, we might increase the number of workshops in the following years. Please let us know how we can develop this activitiy!

Is the workshop included in my conference ticket?
-------------------------------------------------

In short, no. Due to the amount of work required by the instructors to prepare the workshops, and the attention that is needed to be given during the workshops, these are priced separately.

We created individual tickets on our `registration website <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2017/>`_ so that you can register to whichever workshop you choose separately.

The workshops have a limited capacity of **30 people**, so we can provide an effective and comfortable learning experience.

What should I do to prepare for the workshop?
---------------------------------------------

Get excited about learning a new thing! Of course, bringing a laptop or writing tools to take notes is usually recommended.

Workshops require a laptop with some software prerequisites; participants will receive an email listing any (software) requirements well in advance.
