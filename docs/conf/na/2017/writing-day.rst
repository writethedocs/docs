Documenting a new project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check out our `beginners guide <http://docs.writethedocs.org/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/>`_ to writing documentation.
This should help you get started,
and give you some ideas for how you can contribute to a project that you love.

.. _writewrite:

Write Write the Docs on Writing Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This year we're also running a session where you can help improve your favorite website. Yup, you can brainstorm improvements, write helpful content and posts, or just magically improve `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_.

If you're writing text to add to the website, ideally you'll already be familiar with GitHub and writing in plain text (markdown or restructured text), but we'll be there to help out if you're not.

If you'd rather brainstorm a content reorganization in Google Docs, improve our python scripts or our jinja templates we've got plenty to do there as well.

Here are a few things we'll be working on on writing day, reach out to `@plaindocs <https://twitter.com/plaindocs>`_ or `@meker <https://twitter.com/meker>`_ if you have any questions or more suggestions.

Brainstorm user oriented architecture
=======================================

The website is currently organised around meetups, conferences, guides, etc â€“ find ways to introduce user-oriented labels considering audience. Who is coming to the site, why? What are the goals of the site?

- Learn about docs
- Get involved with the community
- Attend conference
- Submit a conference proposal
- Find a video of a talk that I saw

Improve navigation
===================

Let's discuss information architecture -- can we organize the content better? Provide better navigation?

Write articles for the newsletter
====================================

Summarize content from the Slack channel for the `newsletter </blog/newsletter-may-2017/#looking-ahead>`_.

Help develop the Documentation Guide
===========================================

Help reorganize the guide content, or write and edit topics. Check out :doc:`/guide/index/` ahead of time and bring your ideas to the table!"

Fix website issues
===================

We have a list of `issues on GitHub <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awritingday>`_ tagged as `writingday` that includes things like

- fix broken links (we have a lot of these)
- improve the meetup pages
- make a better video archive
- add list of conference write ups for past conferences

.. _kubernetes:

Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're looking to contribute to open source documentation on Github during
Writing Day, you'll have the opportunity to edit content for Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is an open source system that manages containerized applications
across different infrastructures.

The Kubernetes doc folks are looking for help to edit content, get it into
templates, and verify that it conforms to their new site architecture. No
previous product experience is necessary to help out, and they pay in swag,
gracious thanks, and enthusiastic high-fives. Docs are located at `Kubernetes.io
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/>`_ and they're pulled directly from `Github
<https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io>`_.


Mozilla Developer Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides browser-neutral docs on client-side
Web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Web APIs.

You can contribute by writing technical articles, copy-editing,
writing code samples, or translating pages. MDN staff will be there to help out.


Your Project Here
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yup. We know you need better docs. We do too. Make it happen.

Send us an email or pull request with your project and a short paragraph
about what you need help with, and we'll include it here.
