CALL FOR PROPOSALS
==================

Hello hello, fellow documentarians! It's that time of year again: We’re very
excited to announce that we are now accepting talk proposals for our next North
American conference, coming up on May 14-16, 2017, in Portland, Oregon.

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come
up on stage to share their insights and experience. Whether you’ve been writing
documentation for decades or you’ve just started this year, we want to hear from
you! Read on to learn more about the goals of the conference and what we look
for in talk proposals.

In the meantime, mark your calendars: **The deadline for submitting proposals is
Midnight PST on February 10, 2017.** We aim to let you know if your proposal is
accepted by 1st March.

CONFERENCE GOALS
================

The purpose of Write the Docs is to bring together people who are passionate
about documentation and give them an opportunity to interact with and learn from
their peers.

One of the defining characteristics of our community is the broad range of
professional backgrounds we hail from—and our conference seeks to celebrate
that. Whether your job title is technical writer, programmer, product manager,
developer evangelist, support advocate, or something else entirely, we want to
hear from you. Bring us your tips, tricks, experiences, ideas, frustrations,
hopes, or anything else that your passion for documentation inspires you to
share!

WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR
======================

Although the focus of Write the Docs is on documentation, particularly within
the software industry, we aim for a wide range of talks that will lead people
in new directions. We’re after talks that deliver a fresh perspective on or
demonstrate a creative approach to writing the docs.

We encourage speakers at all levels to submit talks. First-time speakers are
great. Experienced speakers are great. Hearing the perspective of a novice
documentarian can be just as valuable as a deep-dive from an industry veteran.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world experience
and research. We also get really excited about talks that make people look at
their craft in a different light. We are always delighted with the breadth of
knowledge that our community brings together.

We tend to avoid talks about specific tools, no matter how awesome they are.

If you already have an idea for what you'd like to speak about, awesome! Pitch
it to us!

If you need some inspiration, below is a handful of example topics we'd love to
hear about. Don't feel limited to these topics *at all*. They're just here to
get your synapses firing.

- Managing your documentation contributors and/or publishing workflows
- Standardizing on existing toolsets versus rolling your own
- Thinking about information architecture in your docs, be they modest or vast
- Contributing back to the open source tools ecosystem
- Improving your writing, whether you're talking mechanics or philosophical
  approach
- Moving beyond gramatically-correct as a baseline
- Measuring, analysying, reporting and optimizing documentation sets
- Creating video, in-app, wearable or other types documentation

*Need some more examples? `Our previous conference websites
<http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/#past-conferences>`__ include the abstracts
and videos for our speakers' presentations.*

PRESENTATION FORMAT
===================

Presentations will be scheduled in 30 minute blocks. We won't be doing Q&A after
the talks, but we ask that speakers be available at the front of the stage
for a few minutes of the break after their talk to answer questions.

**NEW THIS YEAR**: We're also looking for a few speakers who'd be interested in
**facilitating a group discussion, rather than giving a formal talk, as part of
**this year's Unconference. For the past few years, we've held unconf sessions
**downstairs from the main hall. To increase folks' awareness of and interest in
**the unconf, we're looking to get a handful of pre-planned anchor sessions
**(also 30 minutes), to get the ball rolling.

Let us know, in the submission form, whether you'd prefer to give a talk or lead
an anchor session.

SPEAKER BENEFITS & LOGISTICS
============================

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your attendance
fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of travel or lodging for
all speakers at this time. By not covering travel costs for our speakers, we are
able to keep ticket prices low and to make the conference accessible to the
largest number of participants possible. If your proposal is accepted but you
are unable to attend due to travel costs, please let us know and we will do our
best to help make it happen.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the community.

Finally, you’ll hear from us with our proposal decisions by March 1st.
