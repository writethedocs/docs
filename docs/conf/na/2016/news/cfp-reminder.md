# Tickets are going fast and Talk Proposals are due soon

Greetings fellow documentarians! 

The conference is now just a little more than three months away, so we hope you’re getting excited for the latest installment of the amazing Write the Docs in lovely Portland, Oregon!

Early Bird tickets are now sold out. Thanks to everyone who has already purchased a ticket. We do expect the conference to sell out fully, so get [your tickets now](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2016/). 

# Submit your talk by the end of the month

There is still time to submit your talk to Write the Docs!

Remember, too – on the [Call for Proposals page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/cfp/), we’ve got some tips and examples to help inspire you. And if you’ve got an idea, but you’re not sure what to do with it, ask for feedback on [Slack](http://slack.writethedocs.org/). Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

We will be announcing the conference program by **March 25th**.
