Venue
-----

This year's Portland conference will be held at the `Crystal Ballroom`_.
It is a beautiful concert venue located in the `middle of downtown`_ Portland.
It has been a wonderful venue for us the past 2 years,
and we expect this to be another wonderful year.

Accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All conference spaces at the Crystal Ballroom are wheelchair accessible,
except for the balcony where there are no events.

The venue has:

* step-free access to all parts of the conference
* elevators that are open and unlocked during all conference events
* accessible, clearly labeled restrooms

Low Vision or Hard of Hearing
*****************************

Preferred seating will be provided for attendees who request it. Please contact us about any lighting requirements you may have, and we will do our best to meet them.

All transit in Portland announce stops verbally in English. Most buses have a visual display of upcoming stops.

Dietary requirements
********************

We aim to meet all dietary requirements. You will be able to specify these when purchasing your ticket.

Restrooms
*********

Accessible restrooms are clearly marked and easy to find.

The venue does not have gender-neutral or family restrooms available. Use the restroom for the gender with which you identify.

Quiet room
**********

We will have a clearly marked quiet/lactation room available. This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socializing.

Other Venues
************

We are still working on confirming accessibility at our other conference venues.

Did we miss something?
**********************

Have we neglected something you need, or is there something not mentioned that would make your attendance possible or improve your experience? Please `email us`_, and we'll do what we can to provide it.
