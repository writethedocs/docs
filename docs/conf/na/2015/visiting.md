# Visiting Portland

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Portland? The
conference will be held at the [Crystal Ballroom][crystal], in downtown
Portland, and most conference events will be held within just a few blocks of
the Crystal Ballroom.

## Eating

Portland is an amazing food city.
Here are some resources that will help you find something good to eat:

* The [Easter 38](http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38) is a great resource for delightful food.
* Willamette Week's [Restaurant Guide](http://www.wweek.com/restaurants/)
* Urban Spoon's [Best of Portland](https://www.zomato.com/portland)
* [Food Carts Portland](http://www.foodcartsportland.com/)


## Where to stay

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations, but
there are many hotels available within walking distance of the venue:

* [Ace Hotel](http://www.acehotel.com/portland)

## How to get around

Portland is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

### The MAX

The [MAX](http://trimet.org/max) is Portland's major light-rail system.
The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities, such as
Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro.

If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), we recommend taking the MAX
into downtown Portland. There is a MAX station for the [red
line](http://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm) in the airport itself.  The
closest red line stop to the Crystal Ballroom is the Galleria SW 10th stop.

### The Streetcar and Buses

For getting around within and around downtown Portland, the
[Streetcar](http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/) can be a good option.
Portland also has an extensive [bus network](http://trimet.org/bus/).

### Taxi Companies

Portland just got Lyft or Uber, but they are somewhat unreliable.
There are several reliable local taxi companies:

* [Radio Cab](http://www.radiocab.net/)
* [Broadway Cab](http://www.broadwaycab.com/)
* [Portland Taxi](http://portlandtaxi.net/)

Please note that it is _not_ common to hail taxis in Portland, and that
your best bet is to call in advance.

### Bike Rentals

There are two bike rental companies in downtown Portland that may be
good options if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very
much recommend!):

* [Waterfront Bikes](http://www.waterfrontbikes.com/)
* [Cycle Portland](http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/)
