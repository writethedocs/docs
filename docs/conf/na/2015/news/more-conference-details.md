Saturday - Annual Hike

our [annual hike to Pittock Mansion][hike]. We've had rain every year, but
we're optimistic that we'll see some sun this year!

Sunday - Writing Day and Conference Reception
---------------------------------------------

During the day on Sunday, we'll have our [Writing Day][writing-day]
, followed by the reception in the evening.

Both of these events on Sunday are at CENTRL Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St ([map][centrl-map]). Head there at any point during the
day to pick up your badge, join a doc sprint, or meet some of your fellow attendees.

The Writing Day is modeled after the concept of ["sprints"][sprints] from
the open source and software development worlds. The idea is simple: to get a
bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

Sprint projects include
Mozilla's [MDN][mdn] and Write the Docs's [resources for
documentarians][wtd-resources]. [OpenNews][opennews] will also join us to
bring open source to journalism. You are welcome to bring your own project
to work on. Let us know and we will add it to the list on our website, 
so people will know it's an option.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our conference reception.
You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and
snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans so that you can continue
your conversations over more substantial food.

Monday and Tuesday - Conference
-------------------------------

We've released the breakdown of [our daily schedule][schedule], and will
release the full talk schedule soon. The doors
open at 8am on both days, so that you can get there early, get yourself settled,
and grab some breakfast. The introduction begins at 9:00am. Talks
run all day, until shortly after 5pm. 

We'll hold an unconference downstairs in Lola's Room again this year, again on
both days. The unconference begins shortly after lunch,
and will continue until the end of the day. Sessions begin with a
couple of topics to get you started, followed by time for unstructured topics.
