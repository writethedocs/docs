Welcome to Write the Docs
=========================

Hello Documentarians,

The conference is just around the corner. Just a few notes to help your planning:

* **When you get in Sunday, join us at [CENTRL Office](https://goo.gl/maps/xljmU)**. The [Writing Day](/conf/na/2015/writing-day/) is from *9am-6pm*, immediately followed by the reception from *6pm-9pm*. **Both events are at CENTRL Office.** Here's a [map](https://goo.gl/maps/xljmU) of the location. You can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks on us. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts.
* **Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/)**. We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events. Our code of conduct boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the [full text](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) is also available. Our cell phone numbers and email addresses are on that page if you ever need to contact us.
* **Plan a [lightning talk](/conf/na/2015/lightning-talks/)**. We'll have lightning talks each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Plan a discussion**. We'll be running the Unconference] in the afternoon on Monday and Tuesday. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a very specific thing? This is the place. We'll have a sign-up board so you know what's happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
* **Come to the party on Monday night.** This is a private party just for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We'll be at [TILT](https://goo.gl/maps/ZoKCP) with a bunch of awesome free food and drinks.
* **Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided.** Don't worry about coffee before you come to the conference on Monday or Tuesday. Coffee and breakfast are served at 8:15, and the conference starts at 9.
* **Use the hash tag #writethedocs.** Twitter is a great way to communicate at events. If you arrive into Portland early and want to find others, use the hash tag or tweet at @writethedocs. We can point you to something good.
* **Get excited.** This is the third year of Write the Docs, and our community is growing. We have a fantastic venue in a beautiful city, and lots of interesting talks. Come ready to meet other people in the community, and have a great time.

See you soon!
