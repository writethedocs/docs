## Announcing Keynotes, Initial Sponsors, and a Proposal Reminder

The conference is now less than three months away, so I hope you're getting ready
for what will be another great Write the Docs in lovely Portland,
Oregon!

The Early Bird tickets have sold out. Thanks to everyone who has already
purchased a ticket. We do expect the conference to sell out fully, so
[buy your tickets](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2015/)
today.

## Keynote Speakers

In previous years, we've opted not to include keynote talks. As the
community and conference have developed, however, we've noticed
something: we have programmers who care about docs and writers who care
about tech. We collectively call these folks _documentarians_. We
thought we'd change things up this year by offering one keynote talk
from each of these camps.

#### Ward Cunningham

Our first keynote speaker is [Ward
Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham). Ward is the
creator of the wiki and has one of the longest views on how the web is
used of anyone in the world. He will be speaking about his view of
content on the web and how it's shaping his latest project, the
Federated Wiki.

#### Marcia Johnston

Our second keynote speaker is [Marcia
Johnston](http://writing.rocks/marcia-riefer-johnston-bio/).
Marcia is the author of multiple books on writing well and speaks on
the topic at conferences around the country. She will be speaking about
how to make sure the words you write are actually understood by your
readers. A member of our community since the first conference, Marcia
will help us all become better writers once again.

More information about these talks can be found on the
[website](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/#speakers).

## Call for Proposals Reminder

There is still time to submit your talk to Write the Docs!

Our community is full of amazing people,
and we'd love to have you come and share your experiences with us.

We will be announcing the conference program on **March 15th**.

event. Expect to hear more about the hike, writing day, party,
