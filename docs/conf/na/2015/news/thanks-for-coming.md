Thanks for coming to Write the Docs North America
=================================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our third North American Write the Docs conference in Portland! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

We hope you had a wonderful time, and that you are as excited as we are about the beautiful community that is forming. Below we've included all of the resources you might need for staying in touch, like videos, notes, and a forum. We also have a short anonymous survey for you to fill out, so we can make the conference even better next year.

## Tell us how we did

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback!

**Our two question survey is quick and easy, so [go fill it out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s8PYo_VmjBg9-BZEBzD8V7glVBFNFWZ3Lz7dqNGOUic/viewform?usp=send_form).**

## Speak or Sponsor in Europe

Don't forget we have our European conference this year in Prague! The Call for Proposals is still open, and has been extended until June 15. We heard a lot of people excited about submitting, and worried about the deadline, so we've pushed it back to give you a bit more time. 

We're also looking for more sponsors to make the event just as magical as this year's Portland event. If you are curious about sponsoring EU or NA again next year,
please contact us at [sponsorships@writethedocs.org](mailto:sponsorships@writethedocs.org).

You can find information about the conference and Call for Proposals on our [European Conference website](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/).

## Videos

All the videos for the conference are now posted. You can see all the videos from this year of Write the Docs on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkQw3GZ0bq1JvhaLqfBqRFuaY108QmJDK). Thanks again to our wonderful video folks at [Next Day Video](http://nextdayvideo.com/) for turning them around so quickly.

## Our New Forum

Thanks to our awesome community member [Sharon Campbell](https://twitter.com/captainshar), we now have a [Write the Docs Forum](http://forum.writethedocs.org/).

We hope that this forum will serve as the easiest way to share information with the community. Join the forum, and feel free to start a topic or chime in on an existing thread.

## Meetups

We hope you continue to build the community and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city listed, consider starting a meetup! 

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can spread the word.

Thanks for making it another wonderful year.
We hope to see you back again next year,
or even sooner at one of our other events that happen throughout the year.
