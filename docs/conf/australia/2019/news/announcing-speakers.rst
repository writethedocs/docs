Announcing speakers and talks
=============================

G'dday fellow documentarians in Australia and beyond!

We’re happy to write to you with the latest news about our upcoming Australian conference, there’s lots to share and with the conference just over two months away, we hope you’re all getting excited!

Firstly, we’ve finalised our speakers for the event! Every year talk selection gets more and more difficult as we get a larger, stronger batch of submissions. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to
send us a proposal – we literally wouldn’t have an event without you!

We also have some info about ticket purchasing (now’s the time!), call for volunteers, and sponsor updates.

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Every year, we look to bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs stage. Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics – with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure. We're really excited about the presentations we've got this year – we hope you are too!

Head over to the `Speakers <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ page for full abstracts. We hope there’s something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

Call for volunteers
-------------------

There is plenty to do during the conference and volunteers are essential to the success of all our events! We are looking for folks who are willing to help out during the conference. If you volunteer for two or more shifts (at an average of three hours each), you will receive a free ticket for the conference.

We are looking for folks to help out in these roles:

- **Venue set up** - Prepping the main conference hall on Thursday (early morning), including preparing the registration desk, laying out swag, arranging writing day boards, and other light physical labour
- **Workshops/Doc Fixits** - Assisting the Workshops and Doc Fixits speakers, including general information inquiries, directing attendees to specific tables, helping writing day project leads with logistical questions, and other duties as assigned
- **Registration desk/Info** - Registering people in the main conference hall and answering any questions
- **Speakers** - Finding speakers and making sure that they're where they need to be when it comes time to speak
- **Talk Timing** - Keeping track of the length of the talks and warning speakers when they're running out of time
- **Unconference** - Camping out in the unconference area downstairs, keeping the place in order, updating unconference room schedule, and so on
- **Venue take down** - What’s more fun than setting things up? Taking them down! Helping with taking down the conference set up and leaving the conference hall better than we found it
- **Sydney expert** - If you are a Sydney local and would like to share your tips and recommendations or answer questions about places to eat, sightseeing, services, accommodation, or other events that are happening around the conference, we'd love to have you on board!
- **Floaters** - Other duties as assigned ;) Assisting with odds and ends, requests from other volunteers and organizers, as well as answering questions; overall, being generally helpful

If you're not sure how to do any of these tasks, don't worry, the organisers will be available for questions and any problems you may encounter. We also have a dedicated volunteer coordinator and some volunteers from previous years will join us again, so you will have support.

To register as a volunteer for the conference, please read and fill out the `Call for Volunteers form <https://forms.gle/KWm4qgHdbSQuwx6x5>`_. You will receive additional information by mid-October regarding shifts, detailed duties, and other updates to the volunteer duties and schedules.

Please email our volunteer coordinator Alexandra Perkins at australia@writethedocs.org if you have any questions about volunteering for the conference.

Tickets are going fast!
-----------------------

If you don’t have your ticket yet, now’s a great time to snap one up. Last year we reached capacity a week before the conference, and this year we expect to reach it even sooner (we have already sold out 25% of the tickets), so if you’re planning to come, don’t leave it to the last minute.
