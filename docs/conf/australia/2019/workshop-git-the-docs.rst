Git the Docs: A fun, hands-on introduction to version control
==============================================================

Workshop host: **Becky Todd**

Learning Git for the first time can be intimidating, especially for non-developers.
When I first learned Git, I did it the hard way (mostly using internet searches and StackOverflow).
And I hated it. It was confusing, and it seemed like a necessary evil. But it doesn't have to be that way. Learning Git can be fun!

This hands-on workshop will teach you how to use a Git-based workflow for writing documentation.
Together, we’ll walk through some tricky Git concepts, breaking each down into easy-to-understand pieces.
By the end of the session, you’ll have gained confidence with:

- Using the Git workflow day-to-day

- Managing pull requests like a pro

- Handling a basic merge conflict

- Fixing mistakes
