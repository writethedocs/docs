Announcing speakers and talks
=============================

G'day folks!

We're excited to announce that we've finalised our list of speakers and talks for the event!
The selection process was tough as we had a strong batch of submissions. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a pitch – we literally wouldn't have an event without you!

We also have some info about ticket purchasing (now's the time!), trip planning (Melbourne beckons!), opportunities to volunteer and of course our generous sponsors (want to `join them <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_?). Read on for more details!

Speakers and talks
-------------------

This year, we hope to bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs stage. Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics – with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure. We're really excited about the presentations we've got this year – we hope you are too!

Head over to the `Speakers page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ to see the full abstracts. We hope there’s something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

Tickets
--------

We have had the tickets on sale for a couple of months now, but if you were holding off until you saw the talks, delay no further!
If you don't have your ticket yet, now's a great time to snap one up. If you're planning to come, don't leave it to the last minute.

Planning your trip
-------------------

In the next few weeks, we’ll be announcing more details about the conference events, including the full schedule, workshops and the official social event on Thursday evening.

In the meantime, check out the `Visit Melbourne <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/visiting/>`_ page on the conference website for some resources on transport, where to stay, where to eat, etc. You can also pop into the `#wtd-conferences <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/wtd-conferences>`_ channel on Slack to ask questions!


Volunteers

We sent out a call for volunteers a couple of weeks back. If you are interested in volunteering for this event, we have a few roles still available.
