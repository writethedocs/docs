Call for Volunteers
===================

Each year we are blessed with an amazing team of volunteers who help with the variety of on-site operations, and the conference wouldn't be such a success without them!

Volunteering at our events only requires a few hours per day. It's a great way to meet the community, learn about how to run an event, and you get a free ticket to the conference!

We need volunteers for the following roles:

- Explore Melbourne coordinator
- Welcome Wagon coordinators
- Speaker coordinator
- Technical support
- Swag coordinator
- Speaker gifts coordinator
- Greeter at the front desk

For details of what each role requires, look at the `Event Roles <https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/confs/event-roles/>`_ page.


If you're interested, please complete the `volunteer form  <https://goo.gl/forms/W6dmJFl2IJ4PEeYF2>`_. We will be accepting volunteer applications until 3 - 4 weeks before the conference, if there are still open roles by then. You can expect to hear back from us from September 1st onward.

We only have a few openings for volunteers, and we will prioritize those who will be attending for the first time, also those who might not be able to attend otherwise. Unfortunately we cannot help with travel costs for volunteers, so please make sure that you are able to travel to the conference before applying for a role.
