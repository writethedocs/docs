Announcing virtual conference dates
===================================

Write the Docs Australia 2020 will be a virtual conference. For the first time we are partnering with Write the Docs India for 2 days of Asia Pacific documentation goodness!

We're holding the conference in December, to allow for enough time after the new Prague conference dates in October.
The main conference days will be on **{{date.day_one.dotw}}, {{date.day_one.date}}, 11:00-21:00 {{tz}}**,
and the  **{{date.day_two.dotw}}, {{date.day_two.date}}, 11:00-21:00 {{tz}}**.
Essentially, these times will cover timezones to cater for our community from either coast of Australia to the Indian subcontinent later in the day.

We would love to see documentarians from other parts of the Asia Pacific region join us in this APAC timezone friendly conference.

Ticket sales will open end of July. Check out the :doc:`tickets page </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets>` for prices. Your virtual ticket includes:

* Live streaming of all talks
* Q&A with speakers after each talk (may not be available for all speakers)
* Access to the conference chat with all other attendees, speakers and sponsors

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organisations and communities,
who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have drafted a new `sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.
