Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
--------------------------------------------------

G'day everyone,

The Write the Docs Australia and India team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our joint Australia and India online conference such a success.
We're happy to share some of the highlights with you.

Conference recap
================

At over 125 people, this year's conference was our biggest yet! We had the usual mix of main stage and lightning talks, and social events.
Learning from our Portland and Prague events, we were very happy with how well all of our events transitioned to our new online format. We loved how the spirit of the community was so palpable even in an online event, which was even more special given the year we've all had.

Overall, we were excited with how our awesome community came together in our new virtual venue.
Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Videos
======

Videos of the talks and lightning talks are now available on `our YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpl2E5JhVd34llZD4a4oAeCo>`__. We also included the Q&A recordings for the main talks.

Thanks again to `Bart at Work <https://www.bartatwork.com/atwork/>`__ for doing such a great job with these. You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/writethedocs>`__ so you don't miss any future content!

Sketchnotes
============

One of our fantastic volunteers from the conference did some amazing sketchnotes of all the talks at the conference, as a takeaway for attendees.
These sketchnotes are now available for everyone at `WTD AU and India 2020 sketchnotes <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10h8EguUikzaTqRRRScflxRdSBDD1G3Hq?usp=sharing>`__.

Shirts still on sale
====================

If you want a souvenir from this year's conference, our `Write the Docs Australia 2020 Pop-Up Shop <https://teespring.com/wtd-australia-india-2020>`_ is still open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want.

The campaign will run in 3-day batches until January 10th 2021. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened.
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behaviour set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

We are already talking 2021 folks! Our `Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/>`__ has announced its dates for 25-27 April and CFPs are now open.
You can [submit a talk for the Portland conference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/cfp/) until **midnight Pacific time 25 January 2021**.
This conference is also virtual next year, so you can attend or present from anywhere.

Our Slack network has expanded yet again this year.
Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that you will continue the conversations throughout the year.
If you haven't joined, now's the time!
Check out the `Write the Docs Slack <http://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__.

We’re also looking for more sponsors to make our other events just as magical as this year’s Australia and India event.
You can see all our `sponsorship options <https://www.writethedocs.org/sponsorship/>`__ on our website.

Thanks again
============

We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making this conference possible.
Whether you were able to come out this time or not, we hope to see you again next year – or even sooner at one of our other events!
