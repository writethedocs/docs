Announcing Full Schedule, Tickets, Events, and Activities
=========================================================

Hello everyone!

Our first-year event in Vilnius is just over a week away, and we hope everyone is as excited as we are. We're writing today to announce the full presentation schedule and to give you the latest updates to help you make the most out of your conference experience.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

We'll also be running the `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/writing-day/>`_ on Sunday and `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/lightning-talks/>`_ after lunch on Monday.

You'll be able to sign up for Writing Day projects and lightning talks during the conference.

Tickets are going!
------------------

We still have some tickets available, so head over to the `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/tickets/>`_ page and grab one!

Keep in mind that due to printing schedules, if you register after **Monday, 27th May** we will not be able to print a badge for you.

Events and activities
---------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. At each of our events, we try to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge.

Here is the overview of what you can expect during the conference:

* **Writing Day.** The `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/writing-day/>`_ will be held on Sunday from *10:00-18:00*, and you can drop in at any time during the day. If you have a project you want to propose to others, you can pitch your topic during the welcome announcement that will be held at *10:30*. You can sign up for a project during the day, or email us in advance if you want to have your project listed on our website.
* **Welcome reception.** The meet-and-greet event will be held on Sunday from *19:00-21:00* near the conference venue. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts. Stay tuned for location details!
* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/lightning-talks/>`_ on Monday after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want, this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Informal networking.** After the talks end on Monday, we'll set aside space at the conference venue where you can relax and chat with other attendees about the day's talks, the conference, or any topic that you find interesting!

Don't forget to check out the `Visit Vilnius <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/visiting/>`_ page on the conference website, and the local team is happy to answer your questions in the `#wtd-conferences <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/wtd-conferences>`_ channel on Slack.

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm, we're looking forward to see you in Vilnius soon!

The Write the Docs team
