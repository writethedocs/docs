Announcing Events and Call for Volunteers
=========================================

The conference is now just under two months away, and we hope you’re getting geared up for an exciting (and our first ever Down Under) Write the Docs experience in Melbourne, Australia.

`Tickets <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-day-australia-2017>`_ are selling quickly – thanks to everyone who has already purchased theirs!

If you're still debating whether to attend, check out the `Sessions <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/au/2017/speakers/>`_ page for the full list of presentations.

Events and Activities
---------------------

As always, Write the Docs events are more than just talks. Every year we offer a wider range of activities that give our community members different ways to socialize, collaborate, and connect.

Check out what we have in store for you this year in Melbourne:

- **Writing Sprint.** Before the main talks, we'll be hosting a `Doc Sprint <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/au/2017/schedule/>`_ before we dive into the main sessions. This is an excellent opportunity to register early, meet your fellow documentarians, learn about and work on interesting documentation projects, and make yourself at home!

- **Social Event.** TBA.

For the full schedule overview including start/end times for all activities, take a look at our `Schedule <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/au/2017/schedule/>`_ page.

Call for Volunteers
-------------------

Each year we are blessed with an amazing team of volunteers who help with the variety of on-site operations, and the conference wouldn't be such a success without them!

Volunteering at our events only requires a few hours (2-3 shifts of 2 hours, distributed over 3 days), and is a great way to meet the community, learn about how to run an event, and of course you also get a free ticket to the conference!

If you're interested, send us an email at australia@writethedocs.org and tell us a little bit about yourself so that we can try and find a good spot for you on the team. We will be accepting volunteer applications until November 1st, and you should hear back by November 15th.

We only have a few openings for volunteers, and we will prioritize folks who will be attending for the first time, as well as folks who might not be able to attend otherwise. Unfortunately we cannot help with travel costs for volunteers, so please make sure that you are able to travel to the conference before you write to us.

Sponsors
------------------------------

We still have lots of exciting opportunities for sponsorship, if your company is looking for ways to support good documentation. Drop us an email at at australia@writethedocs.org with any questions.

Thanks so much for your help in making Write the Docs possible!
