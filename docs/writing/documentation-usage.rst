Understand documentation usage
##############################

Documentation has value only if it is used.
As a writer, **know the expectations of your documentation readers**.

This document lists some of the most valuable documentation usages.


**********
Visibility
**********

* Search engines read online documentations.
* Documentation makes your project visible.


*********
Discovery
*********

Documentation is used as an entry point to discover a project, starting with
the :file:`README`.

* Newcomers are heavy users of documentation.
* Documentation gives an overview of the project.


*********************
Comparisons, decisions
*********************

* Documentation highlights features, and compares to similar products.
* Documentation quality can make a difference between similar projects.


********
Learning
********

Documentation provides guidelines to go deeper in the project. It points out
interesting topics, provides tutorials, gives examples, etc.


***********
Redirection
***********

As an entry point, documentation is a good place to redirect users to other
services or resources. What can't be maintained in documentation is referenced
in documentation with hyperlinks or other straightforward redirections.


*********
Reference
*********

Users trust documentation. They use it when they are not sure, to apply some
recipe or best practice, to solve discussions, etc.


**************
Remember, find
**************

Users naturally search the documentation for content they can't remember.
**Search is a very important feature.**


******************************
Share "non productive" content
******************************

Some content cannot be stored in scripts, configuration or other "productive"
tools. Vision or conventions can be written in documentation.


*********
Durability
*********

Some contributors leave, others come -- documentation persists.

Documentation is a good place where current contributors can share with
future ones. It's a kind of asynchronous communication channel.
