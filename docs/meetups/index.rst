Meetups
=======

**Write the Docs Meetups** allow for documentarians to get to know their
local community better. Meeting in person is a great way to stay up to
date with the documentation world, and meet some great people in the
process.

All of our local meetups are organized by members of the community in
their own town. They vary in style as much as the individual cities
themselves vary. The main thread that brings people together is caring
about great communication and users of their product.

We invite you to join a meetup in your local community. If your local community
isn't listed here, feel free to `start one <../organizer-guide/meetups/starting>`_
and let us know. We'd be happy to promote it and list it here.

We have several pages of meetup documentation:
