    tweaking the signal to noise ratio to something useful is really difficult. Especially
    when you are curating a site as enormous as MDN, the content of which is open
    licensed, multilingual, and open for public editing.</p> <p>In this talk, MDN

    for your situation, how to stem the torrent and get the right kind of feedback
    and contributions (actually useful), effective begging, stealing and borrowing,

- abstract: <p>As documentarians, our primary goal is delivering the content that
    users need in order to use our products. This might sound simple, but we are often
    writing about complex systems, which will be used by people of varying skill levels.
    Our final publications may have all the words in the right order, but sometimes
    our biggest challenge is getting access to the right content in the first place.</p>
    <p>Deciding on what is the right content can often be hard, and extracting it
    from the development team can be even harder. Some of us might be able to read
    the codebase to decipher what information a user will need. Some of us might get
    to sit in planning and strategy meetings to gain a thorough understanding of our
    user and their documentation requirements. Most of us though will find something
    in the middle - we sit with developers and engineers, build relationships, and
    elbow our way into their process. </p> <p>This talk will look at several ways
    in which to mentor your engineering and marketing specialists so that everyone
    in your team can contribute to the documentation process. I call this "Documentoring"
    - its about training the people around you to understand the requirements of a
    documentarian, and to truly value the docs as part of the product lifecycle.</p>
    <p>Through my experience at IBM, and then at a small startup in Bristol, I've
    seen (and tried) various techniques at getting everyone in your team invested
    in quality documentation. I'll share stories of my successes and failures, and
    show you how documentation really can be a team effort, even if you stand alone
    in your company as the sole owner of the docs.</p>

    \ followed up on by a standardized survey in which more than 110 developers participated.\
    \ Our second study took a different approach. Instead of asking developers what\
    \ they find important about API documentation, we asked them to solve a few tasks\
    \ on a simple (REST)-API that was unfamiliar to them. The goal of this study was\
    \ to observe how the developers approach the tasks and which pieces of the documentation\
    \ provided with the test API they actually use. Besides presenting the design\

- abstract: <p>What are the characteristics of a great documentation set? Completeness?
    Accuracy? Style? Format? No! A great documentation set is one that meets its objectives,
    and sometimes the barrier to greatness is not dedication, skill, or passion, but
    a reluctance to let things go. Every document we publish should reach a certain
    quality threshold - but that threshold varies depending on its audience, the maturity
    of the project, and the overall project goals. What matters is not that docs are
    perfect, but that they are <em>good enough</em>. </p> <p>But how to determine
    if a doc is "good enough"? This talk will cover how to:</p> <ul> <li>Define document
    quality</li> <li>Establish an appropriate quality bar for a document or doc set</li>
    <li>Determine if a document meets that bar.</li> </ul> <p>We're all overloaded.
    We're all stretched for time. Every hour we spend making a doc better than it
    needs to be is an hour stolen from other projects where we could have more impact.

- abstract: <p>Operations tech writing encompasses both hardware and software, and
    the challenge is coming up to speed on the intersecting parts of these 2 disciplines.
    More than any other type of tech writing, operations TW is the art of supporting
    highly technical, cross-functional teams. Most companies create super secret,
    bleeding edge technologies to make their data centers efficient, powerful, reliable,
    economical, and, hopefully, green. There are few opportunities to gain background
    info to bring yourself up to speed and feel confident about your technical prowess.
    </p> <p>This is a little talked about area of TW that's growing in importance
    and demand. At Google, it's been difficult to find writers qualified to handle
    the cross-functional complexities/hit the ground running, and the ramp up is steep.
    I'll address the demands of working in this challenging but fascinating field,
    as well as some cultural perks such as working with physical engineers (mechanical,
    electrical, manufacturing), travel, and developing one's photography skills --
    and saying goodbye to capturing screenshots. </p>

- abstract: "<p>Two years ago, Atlassian had no consistent voice guidelines across\
    \ its content channels and product suite, creating a disjointed brand experience.\
    \ Today, our Information Experience writers now own the Atlassian voice and tone,\
    \ and are teaching everyone from developers, product managers, designers, and\
    \ marketers how to voicify their content. </p> <p>In this talk, Sarah Karp (Information\
    \ Experience Team Lead) will answer the following questions: </p> <ul> <li>What\
    \ is the Atlassian voice? </li> <li>Why is a consistent voice important?</li>\
    \ <li>How can you apply voice and tone to a piece of UI copy? </li> </ul> <p>Along\
    \ the way, Sarah will share ways in which the Information Experience writers have\
    \ applied voicify guidelines across the entire organization. She'll also share\
    \ a couple of lessons on voice and tone gone wrong and how to learn from those\
    \ mistakes. </p> <p>At the end of the talk, you'll come away with an understanding\
    \ of why successful products have a distinctive voice and tone. You'll also come\
    \ away with great examples of voice and tone wins (and fails), and practical tips\
    \ about how to create voicify guidelines for writers and non-writers alike. </p>"

- abstract: "<p>Treating docs as code, an approach that more and more teams and companies\
    \ are moving toward, involves more than putting the two together in a repo. We\
    \ discuss some of the details that often get lost in as dev and docs learn to\
    \ work together in new ways. Because if all we do is put doc files next to code\
    \ files in source control, or use parts of the same workflow for code and docs,\
    \ we're still isolating docs as a separate sort of responsibility, free from the\
    \ obligations of systematic review and testing without which code would never\
    \ be accepted into production.</p> <p>Some missing parts of this newer approach\
    \ to documentation workflow that we'll discuss include:</p> <ul> <li>Outlining\
    \ a documentation lifecycle that describes how material moves from initial draft\
    \ to final production, to help people unfamiliar with documentation development\
    \ understand better how to efficiently manage documentation review and testing.</li>\
    \ <li>Mapping GitHub workflow clearly to documentation workflow. This can help\
    \ writers and editors understand better just how to use GitHub effectively, and\
    \ equally important how it can help other contributors (notably programmers) understand\
    \ the parts of the writer workflow that can be lost when docs move next to code.</li>\
    \ <li>Creating an information architecture. Words need structure to provide meaning,\
    \ usability, and discoverability. A strong content architecture provides logical\
    \ places for adding new content, especially for doc projects at scale.</li> <Li>Developing\
    \ and enforcing a style guide: terminology, voice, tone. These things make the\
    \ difference between words that users might understand, and documentation that\
    \ can truly assist.</li> <li>Reviewing and line/copy editing. Because you wouldn't\
    \ do any less for code, right?</li> </ul>"
