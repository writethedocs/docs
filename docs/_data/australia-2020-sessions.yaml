    <p>A study in 2015 found that 91% of smart phone users turn to their smart phone
    while doing a task. It also found that 1 in 3 millennials say they’ve purchased
    a product after watching a how-to video and that searches related to “how to”
    on Youtube are growing 70% a year*. </p>

    <p>People want to learn how to use your product, and more and more of them want
    to learn through video. </p>

    <p>So how can we help them with that? How can we, as documentarians, translate
    our help page text into quality video tutorials for our customers? </p>

    lone tech writers who have secured their place in the long run as handling everything

    2 years, going out there and proposing a code change for a project whose members
    I didn’t know was very much out of my comfort zone.</p>

    <p>My talk is a reflection on this open source contribution, sharing lessons learned,
    but also sharing advice and resources for those looking to start contributing
    to open source projects. I’ve summed this up into 5 points:</p>

    <p>Contribute to something you care about.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How to find something you care about.</li>

    <li>Take part in open source initiatives and events.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Having mental space and support is important.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Contributing is great, but not at the expense of all your free time and mental health.</li>

    <li>Give yourself the time to learn about the new project.</li>

    <li>How to find the time to contribute.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>How to communicate with people you’ve never met.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Why communication is important and how it can go wrong.</li>

    <li>Learn about community practices.</li>

    <li>Be mindful of how you write issues and comments.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Ask for help if you need it.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How to find help when you’re stuck.</li>

    <li>How to acknowledge someone’s help.</li>

    too, and sadly it's not always glamorous. Docs that start out as a thing of sartorial
    elegance can, many years and patches later, become tired and sad and badly in
    need of retirement. Sometimes the content is so out of date and incorrect, and
    the format is so anachronistic that it needs to be consigned to a recycling bin.
    But not all documentation should be euthanised. Sometimes, it just needs a facelift.</p>

    have saved me half a heart attack. But that was before I’d ever heard of “microcopy”.</p>

    the small bits of text that guide users through their journey, whether on a web
    app, mobile app, or even in text messages and beyond. It includes buttons, menus,
    push notifications, navigation elements, link text… the list goes on and on. It’s
    powerful. (Did you hear about the $300 million-button? I’ll tell you about it
    in this talk!) And often, technical writers, product managers, and even developers
    end up writing it. </p>

    <p>Inspired by Leonid Pasternak''s "The Pains of Composition/The Passion of Creation",
    this talk explores the challenges and power in opening up your creative process
    to collaboration with others. We''ll talk about some of the difficulties we encounter,
    talk about how they affect us, and explore how we can overcome them to do our

    <p>• Writing alongside a complicated spectrum of personalities</p>

    <p>◦ Prevention-focused vs. promotion-focused individuals</p>

    <p>◦ The introversion vs. extroversion scale</p>

    <p>◦ Leading (gulp) from within</p>

    <p>• Building constructive feedback loops and fixing bad feedback</p>

    <p>◦ Now EVERYONE has an opinion?...</p>

    <p>◦ Creating an open dialogue built on a foundation of trust</p>

    <p>◦ Constructive vs. negative feedback</p>

    <p>◦ Modeling healthy feedback</p>

    <p>• Developing a shared motivation and passion</p>

    <p>◦ Who REALLY cares about the documentation?...</p>

    <p>◦ Understanding your value as part of the team</p>

    <p>◦ Forming a shared passion in the team</p>

    <p>◦ Increasing and communicating awareness</p>

    <p>• Thriving in transparency</p>

    <p>◦ What happens when people can WATCH me work?...</p>

    <p>◦ Being real with how writing ebbs and flows</p>

    <p>◦ Pair writing and review, like finger-painting a masterpiece on a shared canvas</p>

    <p>◦ It''s not Big Brother, it''s hand in hand teamwork</p>
