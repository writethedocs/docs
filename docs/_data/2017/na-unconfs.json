According to a survey, only 11% of open-source participants are\nwomen. This disconcerting number can and should definitely be improved.\n\nPeople, especially women find it intimidating to get started with\ncontributing to open source. Why ? I wish to back them up by answering\nquestions, throwing light on the issues that they usually have. It aims\nat introducing the audience to the world of FOSS and elaborate the vast\nrange of opportunities ranging from coding to documentation, design,\noutreach and research.\n\nI shall converse my involvements and experiences in FOSS and its impact\non my tech crusade. A special emphasis shall be on the dearth of women\nin technology. It aspires to inspire budding girl developers and\nshowcase women who\u2019ve made significant contributions to technology.\n\nThe main agenda of the lightning talk is to view the open source world\nbeyond the perspective of coding. It also aims to encourage fellow\nfemale to dive into developing and discuss the vast range of\nopportunities available.\n\nBeing an ardent open-source developer and a female stepping into the\nmale-dominated sphere of technology, I shall definitely add a personal\ntouch to this talk and the audience shall be able to connect well with\nthe session presenter :)\n\n",
