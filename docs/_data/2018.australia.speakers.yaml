- abstract: "<p>Most industries have had what we might call an oh-no moment.
    It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated,
    in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments
    that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,
    but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided
    effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling
    towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed
    to conceive of yet.</p>\n

    <p>In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters
    leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put
    into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major
    moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and
    haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation professionals
    are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the whistle on,
    potential disasters before they happen.</p>"

    <p>In this presentation Mike will cover the most recent developments in the

    lot of hands, a style guide is a necessity. It can provide consistent

    <p>This talk will aim to cover:</p>\n
    <ul>\n
      <li>What does your style guide need to contain?</li>\n
      <li>What are the pitfalls that you need to consider?</li>\n

- abstract: "<p>The most common perception around the term UX writing is that it
    only includes microcopy for the user interfaces. However, that is not
    correct. Writing snappy messages on the UI is only a part of it; more
    important aspect is developing a voice for the product and imbibing that
    voice in your content (UX, help, knowledge base, etc).</p>\n

    <p>This talk covers some of the necessary skills required for being good at
    UX writing and how these skills help us in designing a better product
    experience. Whether be it the decision of keeping the tone professional
    vs casual or using title case vs sentence case, decisions must be taken
    based on the audience and should always be in-context.</p>\n

    <p>And yea, one last thing, technical writers are/can be great UX writers!</p>"

- abstract: "<p>The first few weeks at a new job are hard. There seem to be
   too many questions and not enough answers, and so much assumed knowledge
   about the company you joined and the products they make.</p>\n

   <p>I’m going to talk about how you can make those first few weeks your most
   productive and valuable to your new company. By writing internal
   documentation that answers all the questions only someone new on the block
   knows to ask, you can help pave the way for new hires in the future, and
   even help identify and solve customer pain points.</p>\n

   <p>Drawing from my own experiences working as an intern and support agent
   among highly technical teams, I will go over deciding what to document
   based on the level of technical proficiency you would expect the reader to
   have, how to use tone to convey the company’s spirit and keep a future
   reader interested, and how to future-proof your internal documentation so
   it doesn’t stop being updated when you move on.</p>"

    <p>Except that they're too busy, or in another office, or another timezone,

    <p>This talk will look at the psychology behind why we often don't get the

- abstract: "<p>As an engineer dedicated to improving the safety of
    autonomous vehicles, I am beholden to the automotive industry’s
    standard used for certifying functional safety for EE systems —
    ISO 26262. The purpose of this standard is to minimize the risk
    of harm by enforcing a structured, rigorous product development
    process. This means that before a component can be integrated
    into a vehicle, it must be certified as compliant with the
    aforementioned standard.</p>\n

    <p>Complying with ISO 26262 is a meticulous and arduous process,
    by design. To satisfy this traditionally bureaucratic behemoth,
    extensive amounts of very specific documentation must be furnished
    as evidence that the requirements of the standard were strictly
    adhered to. The scope and purpose of this evidence vastly exceeds
    that of the documentation done in a typical software development
    process. To maintain efficiency and flexibility while developing
    our software, we knew we’d need to lean into automation to grapple
    with this beast.. Our goals are specific to automotive, but we
    predicted the resulting tools and processes would be valuable to
    providing consistency and verifiability to any project. One facet
    of facilitating this goal that we’ve pursued---and is covered by
    this talk---is a specification for constraining Markdown document
    structure and a tool created for validating it.</p>"

    I found myself struggling to get the data I needed to put together an
    argument based on fact, rather than anecdotes. In this session, I’ll take
    the anecdote of my situation and show how analytics enabled my team to
    pull forward, get executive buy-in, enable process change and succeed.
    Over the course of the session, I’ll delve into three primary questions
    and propose where you’ll find some answers.</p>\n

    <ul>\n
    <li>What are some of the metrics you might want to find?</li>\n
    <li>What are your baselines?</li>\n
    <li>What happens if the data doesn’t tell you what you expected?</li>\n

    <p>What your users are telling you about how they access your content
    can tell you volumes about roads to improve all aspects of user
