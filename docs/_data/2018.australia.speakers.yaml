- abstract: "<p>Most industries have had what we might call an oh-no moment. It's\
    \ those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order\
    \ to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that could\
    \ be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation, but the changes\
    \ have never been made. Because the industry has avoided effective regulation\
    \ for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling towards a disaster of epic\

    \ this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters leading to\
    \ regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put into place to\
    \ mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major moments from the\
    \ IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and haven't. Finally, I will\
    \ discuss ways that documentation professionals are uniquely placed to identify,\
    \ and potentially blow the whistle on, potential disasters before they happen.</p>"
