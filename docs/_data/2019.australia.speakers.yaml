    games accessible and as easy as possible for non-technical, non-programmers. As
    part of our work on the BAFTA-winning video game Night in the Woods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods),
    we wrote a narrative game development framework called YarnSpinner (https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner).
    In doing so, we learnt a lot about how to build tools for non-technical writers
    of stories to create interactive and engaging playable narratives. We''d like
    to share what we''ve learned.</p>

    <p>This session explores the best practices for crafting interactive narratives.
    We''ll survey the state of tools (including Twine, YarnSpinner, Ink, and beyond),
    discuss the needs of writers, and look at how interactive narrative content is
    stunningly strange combination of fiction, programming, and self-documenting horror.
    How does it all come together? </p>

    <p>How do we make the complex task of creating stories that need to track state,
    variables, and thousands and thousands of lines of branching dialogue accessible,
    simple, debuggable, traceable, and fun? </p>

    <p>Let''s find out together!</p>'

    defining a strategy for documentation.</p>

    <p>Technical writing or documentation, in general, follows a sort of definitive
    process in all organizations.

    In a perfect world, writers plan, research, interview, organize, write, review,
    incorporate feedback, deliver, and continuously incorporate user''s feedback.</p>

    <p>As a writer, where does our responsibility end? Our primary focus is on creating
    and updating content, but we should not forget about how we can make it more visible
    to our users. Our end-users are looking for information.</p>

    <p>The following steps can help us to become our user''s documentarian:

    - Know your audience

    - Empathize with them

    - Analyze what they need and not what they want

    - Study their behavior and analyze where will they want to get the information

    - Find and develop a way to deliver docs where your audience is most likely to
    search

    - Based on your delivery goal, set up all the resources you need

    - Write and form a network of links for easy navigation

    - Review and incorporate feedback

    - Deliver and integrate your user''s feedback continuously</p>

    <p>It''s not a new way but a unique perspective of writing. It aims to focus on
    being more human in understanding your users'' needs. It''s like a human-centric
    approach to documentation, where you aim for two things: to provide users with
    the information they need and to make it visible to them.</p>'

    <li>Journeys - deliver better experiences for your users by writing in context</li>

- abstract: '<p>We have been asked to do this very much lately. Customers don''t have
    time or patience to sit down and read our User''s Guides, they would rather watch
    a short "How to" video. The delivery managers then ask us, the technical writers,
    to make "a very short, very simple video, explaining only the basic steps, nothing
    too complicated". However, we know these videos are not that easy to make.

    We need:

    1. To see the UI ourselves (many times it''s not even ready).

    2. Time to use and learn the software.

    3. To talk with the developers to have our questions answered.

    4. To write the script.

    5. To have it reviewed.

    6. To practice a few times.

    7. To record the final video.

    Because the relevance of the video content is much higher than that of the written
    content, we must keep up with the times and learn how to make "how to" video tutorials.
    It is actually fun and rewarding!</p>'

    product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get the
    attention of the consumers. It can be looked as a pared down version of a product
    that can still be released. An MVP has generally three key characteristics:

    It has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it initially.

    It demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.

    It provides a feedback loop to guide future development.

    that critical first job - in the software industry. It''s also a great way to
    build a network and establish a reputation in the business. And anybody can contribute
    to open source, right?</p>

    <p>Sure. <em>In theory.</em></p>

    <p>In fact, diversity and inclusion in open source is worse than that of "traditional"
    software. Women, for example, make up ~22% of computer programming professionals,
    but only 3% of Github''s survey respondents identify as female. That''s a problem
    for open source software projects, which draw their strength from the diversity
    of their communities, the knock-on effect is that women and other underrepresented
    groups are even less likely to gain access to careers in technology that rely
    on a great open source portfolio.</p>

    <p>To be successful, and to participate in the economic advancement offered by
    the software industry, all developers everywhere need access to the knowledge
    needed to fully participate in technology. In this talk, we''ll cover the common
    barriers to full participation in the software development industry, identify
    some common myths around knowledge sharing, and share practical research-based
    findings into how to overcome those barriers so that all developers everywhere
    have equal access to the information they need to participate in the knowledge

    our knowledge down to extremely dense symbolism should amaze us every day. Semantic
    writing allows us to add another layer of meaning on top of that, to use content
    bins to organize our writing in a way that allows it to be parsed and reparsed
    for different mediums, audiences, and needs. Understanding semantic writing is
    going to give you a mind-blowing view on all the meta-textual information you
    take for granted every day.</p>

    <p>This talk will cover how to separate meaning from form and how to describe
    that separation to your average user. I''ll also be talking about how industry-standard
    tools assist or hinder our ability to fully leverage the semantic power we have

- abstract: '<p>The purpose of this presentation is to give confidence by sharing
    insights from my experience with authoring four books till date. It was not easy
    starting to write by myself and doing a whole technical piece end-to-end however,
    it took persistence and passion to get it done over a course of two years. Nevertheless,
    despite it consumed me as a person and engulfed all my social and personal life;
    I never regretted doing that as it paid well than I imagined - not monetarily,
    more importantly as an achievement and a path leader to beyond my 9-5.</p>

    <p>During this presentation, I want to share my experiences on how I came about
    the whole idea of writing a technical book, what encompassed the journey, and
    most importantly – how it’s not rocket science to get started on a book. People
    only see a book with a name, they don’t see the efforts behind it but then, how
    will they if they’re not sure what it takes to write one? It becomes even more
    challenging to address one self’s aspirations and limitations unless there’s a
    trend setter – which there is not. By sharing my views on why one should do it
    and how they benefit from it I guess at least a handful people will embark on
    the journey and experience the making of an author.</p>

    <p>As key takeaways – I would like to have audience appreciate that writing could
    be looked upon as being an integral part of a good orator or presenter as they
    already have those skills to covert voice to words. Even for an average 9-5 person
    – they can and should take a stab at it and experience what it is like to create
    something extraordinary with the knowledge and thoughts which were in their mind
    alone till date. I would expect that people get motivated and get charged on how
    they can create legacy and leave behind a work of art of which they’ll be proud
    of when they look back in a time in future. </p>'

    everyone can write. Just like (almost) everyone can count.</p>

    projects assume the community have a good understanding of the English language
    and often North American culture as well. This creates barriers for many solution
    providers, who are the gateway to potentially huge markets for your project.</p>

    <p>This talk discusses some of the cultural differences, particularly for people
    from Asia, in using English language API documentation. It suggests some strategies
    to help diverse audiences understand you APIs and create solutions using them.</p>

    <p>The talk will cover not only differences in language but also other cultural
    differences that are often not obvious. For example:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Different expectations about publication formats, release processes, levels
    of support during the development process</li>

    <li>Meeting and communications styles</li>

    <li>Software development workflows, processes, and tools

    Supporting people who are visually impaired will also be briefly discussed.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>As well as discussing these issues, specific suggestions will be provided to
    make API docs accessible for as many people as possible.</p>

    <p>This talk is based on Alec''s work with customers in Europe, North America,
    Middle East, Asia, and Australasia. The last five have been spent as a developer
