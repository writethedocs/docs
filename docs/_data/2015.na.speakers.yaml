    \ quantity multiplied by itself is equal to three\u201D. The first part of this\
    \ talk explores the development of mathematical writing, which can be divided\
    \ into improvements in symbolic representation and improvements in structure.\
    \ This discussion is partly inspired by Bret Victor\u2019s observation that the\

    \ Users of computer applications certainly expect documentation to live up to\
    \ the same standards. The second part of this talk explores the concept of mathematical\
    \ proof in more depth. We will look at how proofs are structured and use logic\
    \ in a particular way to minimize ambiguity and maximize credibility, and how\

    \ took months. Now, many products are releasing every two weeks at a minimum.\
    \ In addition, the past year has seen features being deployed as soon as they\
    \ pass testing. What\u2019s a tech writer to do!?</p><p> In true agile fashion,\
    \ the response to these challenges varies across products and writers within Atlassian.\
    \ This gives us a breadth of stories and examples I can share about our experiences\
    \ in this world. Here\u2019s a high-level look at what I\u2019ll share:</p><ul>\
    \ <li>A brief discussion of continuous deployment: what does it mean, especially\
    \ for tech writers and others involved in the process?</li> <li>A look at some\
    \ things that have worked for us. Making the mental shift from releases to features\
    \ has been an absolute necessity. We\u2019ve also had to change the tooling we\
    \ use, the processes we follow, and the way we communicate. This journey has also\
    \ forced us to consider what the documentation equivalent of an MVP (minimal viable\
    \ product in Agile development) looks like.</li> <li>There are a few things that\
    \ haven\u2019t worked out very well! Resource-heavy deliverables (like videos\
    \ and tutorials) are really difficult to maintain. Communication also  increases\
    \ in importance in a rapidly-paced cycle. These and other areas provide us with\
    \ some good lessons learned.</li> <li>The jury is still out on a few experiments!\
    \ Things like investing more heavily in in-app help and automating doc publication\
    \ in tandem with code deployment are among the experiments we\u2019re attempting\
    \ to get better at this new world.</li></ul>"

    \ with documentarians like myself, people who were facing similar challenges.\
    \ I wanted to continue feeling that joy.</p><p> I\u2019ll describe my experiences\
    \ creating a Write the Docs Meetup group in Portland. I\u2019ll show you how easy<b>&#42;</b>\
    \ it is to create a Meetup group, attract members, get sponsors, find speakers,\
    \ and make sure all members of your group feel welcome. I\u2019ll tell you about\
    \ the Meetups we\u2019ve had, and what we learned from each other.</p><p> More\
    \ importantly, I\u2019ll lay out the ways you can continue the conversation we've\
    \ had during WTD 2015. I'll share my best practices for excellent Meetups for\
    \ Documentarians.</p><p> <b>&#42;</b><i>Yes, \u201Ceasy\u201D is a euphemism for\

- abstract: "<p>At OutSystems we make an awesome development platform, but our documentation\
    \ wasn't that awesome. We focused on describing each button available on the user\
    \ interface, and not the user intentions and goals.</p><p> A clear example of\
    \ this, was that we had a full documentation page for the find text feature (CTRL+F).\
    \ It described in excruciating detail every option available on the UI, but didn't\
    \ told our users how they could actually find what they needed!</p><p> For us\
    \ it was a nightmare to maintain the docs. Our development environment was constantly\
    \ changing and we couldn't keep up with the changes.</p><p> More importantly,\
    \ we weren't meeting the user needs. And that was clear from pages with a single-digit\
    \ page view, and from the feedback we got from our customers.</p><p> Due to this\
    \ approach, we also ended up having page titles that were feature-oriented, which\
    \ is not the best for SEO.  For instance, the doc page for the find text feature\
    \ was called \"Find Tool\".  Who in their right mind would search for that on\
    \ Google?</p><p> In this talk I'll tell you the story of how we stopped trying\
    \ to document the UI, and started creating user-story driven docs.  We now focus\
    \ on what the user wants to achieve and how to achieve it, independently of how\
    \ many windows or buttons they need to go through.</p><p> I'll cover:</p><ul><li>How\
    \ you can check if you're documenting the UI, and why you should avoid doing it</li><li>Why\
    \ users stories work better for our users</li><li>How focusing on user stories\
    \ changed the culture of our team and allowed us to work on what really matters.</li><li>I'll\
    \ also share some unexpected outcomes, like how this lead us to work closer than\
    \ ever with the development teams. Now our users get twice the cake: better features\
    \ and better docs!</li></ul>"
