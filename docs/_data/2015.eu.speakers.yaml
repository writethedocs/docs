- abstract: "<p>A picture says more than \u2026how many lines of code?</p>\n\n<p>Firstly\
    \ this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as\nwell as experimental\
    \ visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it explores\nthe question whether\
    \ or not these approaches can be applied to software\ndocumentation in a reasonable\
    \ way.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and\
    \ estimates\ntheir corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill, resources\
    \ and\npotential automatization.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, this talk presents an initial\
    \ attempt to translate existing\ndocs into visual languages and discusses the\
    \ according outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Primarily, the objective of reading and writing\
    \ the docs serves the\npurpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the\
    \ same time, the\nexperience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building\
    \ a Visual\nDocumentation Language serves to reach this goal.</p>\n"

- abstract: "<p>Most of the documentation we read today puts a lot of burden on us\
    \ before\nwe have the chance to get to the gist. Abstract and clear concepts are\n\
    replaced by concrete and comprehensive ones. The real values are hindered by\n\
    opaque clouds of facts about tools of trade. As a result, thinking and\nimagination\
    \ are suppressed.</p>\n\n<p>But what if we can write documentation that encourages\
    \ thinking?</p>\n\n<p>Let's look together on what really matters when documenting\
    \ computer\nsystems. We will discuss how a documentation and system design can\
    \ walk hand\nin hand and to improve the communication between both humans and\n\
    machines.</p>\n"
