# Style Guides

A style guide contains a set of standards for writing and designing content. It helps maintain a consistent style, voice, and tone across your documentation, whether you're a lone writer or part of a huge docs team. It can provide guidelines for different documentation deliverables, such as API reference manuals, tutorials, release notes, or overviews of complex technical concepts.

A style guide saves documentarians time and trouble by providing a single reference for ways to write about common topics, features, and more. The consistency it helps provide in your writing gives your readers confidence in the authority of the content, makes your content easier to read, and can help reduce your users' [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load).

## Write your own style guide?

A style guide can be something as simple as a list of decisions you've made about how to refer to different items you frequently write about, or as complex as the mighty tomes of major publication houses. You can certainly roll your own, and for the sake of simplicity this might be a good approach if you're a lone writer, or just starting a small docs group. But neither software nor its documentation operates in a vacuum, so it's a good idea to consult other resources as well. Working from an existing style guide can also help you figure out which things matter in your style guide.

## Style guide resources

Style guides have been around for as long as people have been publishing in any format. Older style guides originally intended for specific forms of print publication have become basic standards for many others to refer to, including documentarians:

- The [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)
- The [AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/)

Classics for software documentation include:

- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

## Thinking about accessibility and bias

It's important to consider accessibility and biases in your style guide to ensure the content you produce can be understood by all readers. 

Writing for accessibility includes making sure copy can be read by screenreaders, content organization, style and color of text emphasis, and more.

Reducing bias in your writing asks you to consider the meanings and origins of your word choices and how those might be perceived or understood by your readers. It can also include providing a range of example names from different cultures -- fortunately, resources are increasingly available to help you with this kind of attention to your writing.

And providing a wide range of example names from a diversity of cultural backgrounds can also help reduce bias in your documentation.

### API documentation

Clear, well-formatted, and detailed API documentation is the key for developers to quickly consume and implement your API. It is also key to helping developers understand what happens when an API call is made, and in the case of failure, understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

From the perspective of a user:

> If a feature is not documented, it does not exist. If a feature is documented incorrectly, then it is broken.

The best API documentation is often the result of a well [designed API](#documentation-driven-design). Documentation cannot fix a badly planned API, and it is best to work on developing the API and the documentation concurrently.

If your API already exists, automated reference documentation can be useful to document the API in its current state. If your API is still being implemented, API documentation can perform a vital function in the design process.

#### Documentation-driven design

If your API isn't built yet, you can create API documentation to help with the design process. The documentation-driven design philosophy comes down to this:

> Documentation changes are cheap, code changes are expensive.

By designing your API through documentation, you can easily get feedback and iterate your design before development begins.

Some API documentation formats have the added benefit of being machine readable. This opens the door to a multitude of additional tools that can help during the entire lifecycle of your API:

- Create a mock server to help during the initial API design
- Test your API before deployment to ensure that the API and the documentation matches
- Create interactive documentation that allows developers to perform demo requests to your API

#### Test-driven documentation

Test-driven documentation aims to improve upon the typical approaches to automated documentation. It allows you to write the bulk of the documentation by hand while also ensuring its accuracy by using your API's tests to generate some of the content.

Projects such as [Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs) use your API's tests to generate small snippets of documentation that can be included in hand-written API documentation. The accuracy of the documentation is ensured by the tests â€“ if the API's documentation becomes inconsistent with its implementation the tests that generate the snippets will fail.

## Content guidelines

It's important to create consistency in your content types. This allows you to manage your audience's expectations for what they will learn on any given page.

### FAQs

Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQs) exist to educate and guide users through need-to-know information, pointing them to additional resources when necessary. FAQs should be short and limited.

Effective FAQ pages accomplish the following:

- Reflects the audience needs. This may be derived from understanding search results which lead to the website or documentation.
- Regularly updated to reflect the changes in user behavior and data.
- Drives users to different parts of the website to deliver more detailed information.
- Cover a broader range of topics that may not otherwise warrant individual pages or pieces of content.

### Release notes

Release notes exist to provide users with vital information needed to continue to use and benefit from a product, often as it relates to new or updated feature releases. These notes should be brief, linking out to more details as necessary.

Consider the following when creating an entry for your release notes:

1. What is the change/release?
1. Why did we make this change? Why is it important to our users?
   1. Improvement in workflow or UI
   1. Consistency/feature parity
   1. Expected revenue increase/decrease
   1. Change in phase: Alpha/Beta/GA (Does this need to be called out?)
   1. Policy/legal changes
1. What is the goal for our users who use this feature?
1. When will this feature be available? Is it already available or coming soon?
1. Do our users have all the information they need to move forward?
1. Is there an additional article for users to read to learn more?
1. Would an image be beneficial to help users understand this release?
1. What stakeholders have to approve this content? Does it require the legal team's approval?
