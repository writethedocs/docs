# Style Guides

A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of content, defining the style to be used in communication within a particular organization. Basically, style guides are put together to clarify [the way a group of people talk and write about the things they do](http://www.writethedocs.org/style-guide/). Think of authoring best practices.

If you happen to have a background in academia or journalism, you will probably be familiar the [AP stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook) or the [Chicago manual of style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html). Those are great resources for writing in general, particularly for grammar and syntax, but if you're reading this page chances are you are considering style in the context of technical documentation.

There are style guides that help you write a variety of content, such as documenting the methods of an API, or presenting a overview of complex technical concepts, or focusing on how to write particular deliverables like user manuals, release notes, or tutorials.

Other style guides help you communicate to developers, product managers, the general public, etc. Others provide best practices on how to manage your content, version control, or publication and delivery strategies.

## Why do I need a style guide?
A practical reason to use a style guide is that they help you author content. Human languages are extremely flexible, and there are in which a particular message can be communicated. By following a style guide you limit all that variation, making it easier for you to focus on getting your message across. This makes style guides extremely useful for people joining projects.

Style guides also increase consistency in your content. There are good reasons why you want to keep consistent tone, voice and style in your documentation. Marketing-oriented folks understand the importance of voice and tone in building a brand identity, but consistency also has a big impact on how effectively you communicate -- that is, on how well you manage to transfer a particular information to your audience.

There's actual science behind this. Our brains appear to be hardwired to identify differences -- anything that stands out from its context will catch our attention. A lot of variation will drain our cognitive resources, making it more difficult for us to assimilate information. The degree to which cognitive resources are drained varies between people, but in general it is a good idea to minimize the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) of your communications.

## Different styles for different folk

Choosing the right style guide for your project depends on your particular context:
  - Who you are
  - Who you are writing for
  - What you are writing about

### Selecting a good style guide for you

If you belong to an open-source community or NGO, you can consider the following resources:
    - [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov)
    - [Open SUSE Style Guide](https://doc.opensuse.org/products/opensuse/Styleguide/opensuse_documentation_styleguide_sd/)

    - [Department of Defense Writing Style Guide and Preferred Usage](http://www.esd.whs.mil/DD/)

If are employed by a for-profit company, there may already be a style guide at use somewhere within your organization.
It is a good idea to ask your colleagues about this before you consider picking a particular style guide for your project.
Here are some good general resources -- perhaps someone in your company is already using one of these:

### Selecting a good style guide for your audience

Good writing takes its audience into consideration and adjusts to the needs and expectations of that audience.
Take this into consideration when selecting your style guide: your audience may have different expectations when it comes to issues like tone or technical detail.

> You can imagine that the expectations of the end user of an electrinic app and those of a full stack developer will be pretty different.

### Selecting a good style guide for your content

Technical documentation takes many forms. Manuals, release notes, tutorials, API documentation, or knoledge bases can all present different challenges and requirements. While some style guides can adequately cover general areas of voice and tone, you may need to find or develop a particular style guides that covers the types of content you are actually developing.

### Creating your own style guide

If you think that none of these resources met your needs, maybe you should consider creating your [own style guide document](http://www.writethedocs.org/style-guide/).
