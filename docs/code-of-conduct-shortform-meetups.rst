Code of Conduct (Meetups)
=========================

Write the Docs is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. 

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. See our reporting guidelines `here <../code-of-conduct/#reporting-and-contact-information>`_. Our full Code of Conduct can be found at `this link <../code-of-conduct>`_.

If you're a meetup leader, when possible, include the following excerpt in your opening remarks:

**"We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants."**

If you cannot include that excerpt, make sure you include a link in the meetup notice. Consider sharing hard copies with contact details at the venue. All meetup members are welcome to use conduct@writethedocs.org to report issues. 

If you include this excerpt in a slide, include `this link <../code-of-conduct-shortform-meetups/>`_ to the Meetup short form CoC.
