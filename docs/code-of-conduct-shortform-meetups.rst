Code of Conduct (Meetups)
=========================

Write the Docs is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion, and mental and physical ability.

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. For more information, see our `reporting guidelines <../code-of-conduct/#reporting-and-contact-information>`_ or full `Code of Conduct <../code-of-conduct>`_.

If you're a meetup leader, when possible, include the following excerpt in your opening remarks:

**"We are dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants."**

If you cannot include that excerpt, include a link in the meetup notice. If possible, share hard copies with contact details at the venue. All meetup members are welcome to use conduct@writethedocs.org to report issues. 

If you include this excerpt in a slide, include a link to the `Meetup short form CoC <../code-of-conduct-shortform-meetups/>`_.
