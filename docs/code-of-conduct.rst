Code of Conduct
===============

Like the technical community as a whole, the Write the Docs team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're participating within this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors, admins, and those seeking conversation, discussion, help, and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you must do or can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended. It's a guide to make it easier for all of us — event attendees and members of the broader community — to foster enriching, supportive experiences.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces associated with the Write the Docs community, whether virtual or face-to-face. This includes Slack, the discussion forum, social media, conferences, meetups, and anywhere else Write the Docs might show up. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. 

* **Be friendly and patient.** At every opportunity.

* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* **Be considerate.** Anything you say — and certainly anything you do — in this community has an impact your peers and colleagues. Be mindful of that impact. Also, remember that we're a world-wide community, working in an incredible variety of circumstances. We all speak different languages, use different tools, have different priorities. Assume that everyone you talk to is coming to the conversation from a different perspective than yours — and remember how valuable that is.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot take that frustration out on one another. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Write the Docs community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Write the Docs community.

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants, individually or as a group. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, **if someone asks you to stop, then stop**.

* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Write the Docs is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Write the Docs comes from its varied community — people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. And don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), which in turn credits the original text of the Speak Up! project, inspired in its turn by the Fedora Project, as well as the Python Mentorship Project and many others. We are all dwarves sitting on the shoulders of giants.
