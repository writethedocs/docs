# Code of Conduct

## Short Version

**Write the Docs** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of community member in any form. Offensive language
and imagery is not appropriate in any event or online platform.
Community members, sponsors, and affiliates violating these rules may
be sanctioned or expelled from events or online platforms without a refund
at the discretion of the organizers.

## Long Version

Like the technical community as a whole, Write the Docs is made up of a mixture
of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of
the mission, whether it's in our conferences, meetups, or online platforms.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues
and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere
to. This code applies equally to founders, organizers, sponsors, and affiliates.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit
in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical
communities in which we participate.

### The principles

- Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic
class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse
for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then,
but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to
remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
one. Members of the Write the Docs community should be respectful when dealing with other
members as well as with people outside the community.

- Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct
ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### Where does the CoC apply

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Write the Docs. This includes:

- Conferences, including social events and peripheral activities
- Unconferences and sprints
- Meetups
- Workshops
- Presentation materials used in talks or sessions
- Slack
- Mailing lists
- GitHub
- Twitter hashtag
- forum.writethedocs.org
- meetup.com discussion boards
- Any other forums created by the which the community uses for communication.

In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's
ability to participate within them.

### Exhibitors & sponsors

When you sponsor a Write the Docs event, we welcome you into our community,
and we expect you to be respectful to the community you operate within.

All exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
activities are also subject to the code of conduct. In particular,
exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.
Booth staff (including volunteers) must not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes,
or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

In addition, sponsors for conference, meetups, and online activities should not
employ aggressive recruiting techniques, invasive marketing behavior, or similar
actions towards community members. In case of violations, sponsors might be sanctioned
and expelled from the event or activity with no return of the sponsorship contribution.

### What to do in case of violations

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during one of our events,
please **contact a member of the event staff immediately**. Event staff can
be identified by t-shirts/special badges.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct in one of our online
platforms, we ask that you report it by [emailing us](mailto:support@writethedocs.org).

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases a public statement might be
required (for example in a CoC transparency report following conferences), but these
reports are anonymized and do not include any personally identifying information.
