# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

Our talk selection process has just wrapped up and we're eager to
announce the presentations for this year's conference. Each year we select talks that emphasize
intersections between tech writers and developers, because we all have so much to learn from each
other.

In the next few weeks, we'll be announcing the details for the
conference events: the annual hike on Saturday, the writing 
day and reception on Sunday, and the official party on
Monday evening. 

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, you still have some time. You can
pick up your tickets [here][tickets]. 

Coming to Portland, but need help planning your stay? We have published some [resources
on where to stay and how to get around][visiting].
