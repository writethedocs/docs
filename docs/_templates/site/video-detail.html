				<p>Getting feedback on your work is a necessary part of any project, and it makes your output stronger and more diverse. But it can be hard when your work is being evaluated. Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers have a deep and abiding interest in pain. You’ll never succeed! Well, you have already succeeded just by asking for feedback. Together, we’ll discuss how to build up your tolerance for taking that feedback.</p>
				<p>Feedback became so much easier for me when I learned design critique guidelines from a co-worker and UX Designer. Design critique guidelines are a set of rules and practices that can make getting and giving feedback easier. After presenting this speech at the Write the Docs Portland 2017 conference, I received a ton of great feedback on it. Now, I have even more strategies to share so that you can implement design critique guidelines into your own review process to make feedback painless.</p>
