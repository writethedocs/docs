Announcing Initial Speakers, Sponsors, and Ticket Prices
========================================================

Wow.

Thanks to everyone for making the announcement and first couple days of `Write the Docs`_ a success. We've been floored with the number of pre-registrations and talk submissions that we've received.

We're proud to announce the first round of speakers and sponsors for the event. We will be announcing speakers and sponsors weekly, as we confirm them. We are also happy to announce pricing information today, as we know that has been one of the big questions.

Speakers
--------

A conference depends on lots of parts, but having great speakers is the most important. They will set the tone of the conference, and give us all something to think about. We have been trying to find speakers from different backgrounds in the documentation world. In that spirit, we're happy to announce the first three speakers of the conference:

    * `Nóirín Plunkett`_
        Nóirín Plunkett is a jack of all trades, and a master of several. By day, she works for Eucalyptus Systems, as a geek<->English translator, and general force multiplier. She's passionate about community, communication, and collaboration.

    * `Kenneth Reitz`_
        Kenneth Reitz is the product owner of Python at Heroku and a member of the Python Software Foundation. He embraces minimalism, elegant architecture, and simple interfaces. Kenneth is well known for his many open source projects, specifically Requests. His projects are always well documented, and he is the curator of the The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python, which documents best practices for Python developers.

    * `Jim Wilson`_
        Jim R. Wilson started hacking at the age of 13 and never looked back. He has contributed to open source projects such as MediaWiki and HBase, and managed the large-scale documentation system at Vistaprint. He's co-author of one NoSQL book, and currently writing a node.js book.

The `Call for Proposals`_ is open until Febuary 11. Submit a talk today!

Price
-----

Pricing conferences is a hard business. Since the inception we have wanted Write the Docs to be accessible to everyone, and to be a community conference. This means that everyone in the community needs to be able to afford to come to the conference. In this spirit, we are happy to announce that the price for the conference will be **$75**. Along with this, we will be offering a limited number of early bird tickets, starting next week, priced at **$55**.

Sponsors
--------

As you may have noticed, we have kept the prices for this years conference very low. This is possible through sponsorships who help to defray the cost to attendees. We are very grateful to these organizations who have helped us put the conference on.

The initial sponsors for Write the Docs are:

     |Basho|_
     |Urban Airship|_
     |Wufoo|_
